One-dimensional geometry describes straight and curved lines. Plane geometry is the subject that describes two-dimensional shapes including circles, triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. Solid geometry examines three-dimensional shapes including cubes, spheres, cones, and cylinders. More than any other branch of mathematics, geometry helps us observe and measure our physical world. We use geometric concepts when we calculate the size of shapes using perimeter, area, and volume. We also analyze the properties shapes through study of the parallel and perpendicular lines that comprise them, the number and sizes of their angles, and how the lengths of the sides and sizes of angles compare. </p>\n\n<p>A special branch of geometry, called analytic geometry, locates points on the plane using Cartesian coordinates (named for the philosopher and mathematician Rene Descartes), most commonly taught as a pair of values of variables called x and y. In analytic geometry, the point (x, y) describes the horizontal distance x, and the vertical distance y, that a point is from a central starting point or origin.

We could use the quadratic equation,\nbut let’s factor it instead, which gives us\n\n$$\\left( n - 8 \\right)(n + 3) = 0$$\n\n(You should check that you agree with this factorization, by using FOIL\nto multiply out all the terms). The only way to multiply two quantities\nand get a product of 0 is if one of them must be 0. So either (n-8)=0,\nor (n+3)=0. That leads to two possible values: n=8 or n= -3. Note that\nthe question asked for a positive number, so the solution is n=8.\n\nYou can learn more about writing equations from story problems here:\n<https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/word-questions-solving.html>\n\nHere is a good review of factoring quadratic equations:\n<https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/factoring-quadratics.html>",

A quantity whose rate of change is constant\nwill form the graph of a line. If the population is increasing, then the\n*slope* would be *positive*, and if it is decreasing, the slope would be\nnegative.\n\nChoice A. The slope is zero if the population does not change at all on\naverage. The line is horizontal.\n\nChoice B. A positive slope means the population is increasing. This is\nthe correct choice.\n\nChoice C. A negative slope means the population is decreasing. The line\ngoes down as we move to the right.\n\nChoice D. An undefined slope means that the line is vertical. If Ben\nmeasured population over the past 10 years, we couldn’t have a vertical\nline, because we would have a population value for each of the past 10\nyears, which means the graph would move from left to right.\n\nYou can review interpretation of slopes here:\n<http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/slope.html>",
