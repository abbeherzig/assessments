The eldest was twelve, the\nyoungest nine. They were gathered beneath a dune in lively discussion. Some were\nstanding. Others sat. One rested his chin in his hands, elbows dug deep in the sand. As they\ntalked, the sun went down in the west.\n    Their talking now over, the boys galloped off along the water's edge. From inlet to inlet\neach ran as he pleased. The group was quickly dispersed. One by one they retrieved what\nthe storm had brought two nights before and the ebb tide had left behind: rotted boards, a\nchipped bowl, bamboo slivers, chunks of wood, an old ladle with the handle torn off. The\nboys heaped them up on a dry patch of sand away from the lapping waves. All that they\ngathered was soaking wet. ...\n    The spoils of their hunt they had gathered for burning. With the red flames, wild joy\nwould be theirs. Running and leaping across, they would prove their courage. And now\nfrom the dunes they gathered dry grass. The eldest stepped forward and touched it with\nfire. They stood in a circle and waited to hear the crack of bamboo split by the flames. But\nonly the grass burned. It caught and died, caught and died. A few puffs of smoke floated\nup, nothing more. The wood, the bamboo were untouched. The mirror frame only was\ncharred here and there. With a weird hiss, steam shot out from the end of the pole. One\nafter another the boys dropped to the sand and blew at the pile as hard as they could. But\ninstead of flames, smoke arose, stinging their eyes. Their cheeks were stained with tears. ...\n    Look, look, one boy shouted, the Izu hill fires! If their fires burn, then why shouldn't\nours? All leaped to their feet, looking out towards the water. Far across the great Bay of\nSagami two fires flickered and trembled, so feeble they might be just will-o'-the-wisps. Now\nthat harvest is over, the farmers of Izu must be burning the chaff of their fields in the hills.\nSurely these are the fires that bring tears to the eyes of winter travelers. Their distant\nbeams tell only of the long, dark road ahead.\n    The boys danced wildly and clapped and sang, The hills are burning, the hills are\nburning. Their innocent voices rang through the dusk, down the long, lonely beach. The\nwhispering of the waves blended with their voices. The waves rushed in from the southern\ntip of the inlet in foaming white lines. The tide was beginning to rise. ...\n    Still vexed by their failure, the eldest boy looked back at the pile as he ran. One more\ntime he looked back from the top of the dune before running down the far side. It has\ncaught, he shouted, Our fire has caught, when he saw the flames on the beach. The others,\namazed, climbed back to the top. They stood in a row and looked down.\n    It was true. The stubborn bits of wood, fanned by the wind, had caught fire. Smoke\nbillowed up and red tongues of flame shot out, disappeared and shot out again.

And on the desolate beach the fire burned, alone,\nuntended. ...\n\n- Kunikida Doppo\nexcerpted from \"The Bonfire\"\nMonumenta Nipponica: Studies in Japanese Culture, 1970\nThe Voyagers' Press\n<sup>1</sup>report - an explosive noise",

So it was almost by accident that a new world of cycling was\nopened to people with disabilities. ...\n    \"The disabled community picked up on it right away,\" said Ian Lawless, Colorado\nregional director and cycling director for Adaptive Adventures. Even people with one\nworking arm can handcycle with some modifications made to the equipment, said Lawless.\n\"Just about anyone can do it. It's an accessible sport. It's not just for racing; it's also for\nrecreational riding. It's a barrier breaker that allows a disabled rider to participate in cycling\nwith friends and families who may be riding conventional bicycles.\"\n    In the 25 years since its development, handcycling has continued to grow in popularity.\nIt's been part of the IPC [International Paralympic Committee] cycling program since 1998,\nand the 2004 Paralympics included handcycling racing for the first time. Today, thousands\nof people, able-bodied and those with disabilities, have turned to handcycling as a means to\nimprove their cardiovascular health, increase upper-body strength, compete, and ride with\nfriends and family. ...\n    An upright handcycle is an entry-level bike for those who are new to the sport, who just\nwant exercise or recreation, or who don't want to ride very long distances or go very fast.\nBecause of their higher center of gravity, upright handcycles aren't suitable for speeds\nhigher than 15 mph. The internal gear systems, borrowed from the cycling industry,\nusually come in a choice of three or seven speeds, which naturally limits the speed to less\nthan 15 mph. They are easy to transfer in and out of from a wheelchair, and have a natural,\nfork-type steering system.\n    Recumbent<sup>1</sup> handcycles come in a few different variations. There are two steering\noptions: fork-steer and lean-to-steer, and two seating options: one where the rider reclines\nand the other, a \"trunk-power\" version, where the rider leans forward. They usually come\nwith 27-gear drivetrains,2 although they can be purchased with three- or seven-gear\ndrivetrains.\n    The trunk-power handcycle doesn't have much of a seatback. The cranks are low to the\nground and far away from the rider. With this arrangement, riders are able to put the weight\nof their trunks behind each stroke, allowing them to go faster for longer. The limitation to\nthis type of handcycle, Lawless said, is that the athlete must have control of most or all of\nhis abdominal muscles, so it may not be suitable for all athletes.\n    With the other seating option, the rider sits in a seat with a reclined back. The cranks\nare higher and closer, allowing the rider to use the seatback for leverage to rotate the\ncranks. ...\n    The lean-to-steer version has a two-piece frame where the top frame swivels over the\nbottom frame. The front wheel turns along with the seat. The rider initiates the turn by\nleaning his whole body. There is a bit of a learning curve with this type, but many riders\nprefer this type because they have a feel similar to monoskiing.3 They're used primarily, but\nnot exclusively, by people with lower-level disabilities. Lawless said there's no advantage of\none type of steering over the other.

Today, thousands\nof people, able-bodied and those with disabilities, have turned to handcycling as a means to\nimprove their cardiovascular health, increase upper-body strength, compete, and ride with\nfriends and family. ...\n    An upright handcycle is an entry-level bike for those who are new to the sport, who just\nwant exercise or recreation, or who don't want to ride very long distances or go very fast.\nBecause of their higher center of gravity, upright handcycles aren't suitable for speeds\nhigher than 15 mph. The internal gear systems, borrowed from the cycling industry,\nusually come in a choice of three or seven speeds, which naturally limits the speed to less\nthan 15 mph. They are easy to transfer in and out of from a wheelchair, and have a natural,\nfork-type steering system.\n    Recumbent<sup>1</sup> handcycles come in a few different variations. There are two steering\noptions: fork-steer and lean-to-steer, and two seating options: one where the rider reclines\nand the other, a \"trunk-power\" version, where the rider leans forward. They usually come\nwith 27-gear drivetrains,2 although they can be purchased with three- or seven-gear\ndrivetrains.\n    The trunk-power handcycle doesn't have much of a seatback. The cranks are low to the\nground and far away from the rider. With this arrangement, riders are able to put the weight\nof their trunks behind each stroke, allowing them to go faster for longer. The limitation to\nthis type of handcycle, Lawless said, is that the athlete must have control of most or all of\nhis abdominal muscles, so it may not be suitable for all athletes.\n    With the other seating option, the rider sits in a seat with a reclined back. The cranks\nare higher and closer, allowing the rider to use the seatback for leverage to rotate the\ncranks. ...\n    The lean-to-steer version has a two-piece frame where the top frame swivels over the\nbottom frame. The front wheel turns along with the seat. The rider initiates the turn by\nleaning his whole body. There is a bit of a learning curve with this type, but many riders\nprefer this type because they have a feel similar to monoskiing.3 They're used primarily, but\nnot exclusively, by people with lower-level disabilities.

We pack and\npack-eighty boxes already, and so far, with two weeks still to go, we haven't missed a thing.\nWhat do we keep it all for? Books and more books; unused wedding presents and\nmismatched wine glasses; worn-out stuffed animals and outgrown toys; sheaves of letters;\nboxes of loose photographs; a landfill of sweaters, shoes, and clothes: the weighty\napparatus of four lives. It will take more than two hundred book boxes, dish barrels, mirror\nboxes, mattress crates, a football field of paper, bubble wrap, and tape to contain it all. We\nwant to contain it. We want to hold it tight. ...\n    <i>There's no place like home</i>, Dorothy chants, clicking her ruby heels as she recites her\ndream-dissolving spell. I've moved half a dozen times since I first left my parents' house for\ncollege, twenty-five years ago this fall, and sometimes I wonder if there is any place I'll ever\nreally feel at home. I feel loose-footed on this spinning planet, as displaced as those\nmountains vanished in the fog. Of course, you don't have to move physically to leave\nyourself behind. Something is lost with every tick of the second hand on the clock. ...\n    My parents still live in the house in which I grew up, and my childhood room remains\nalmost exactly the way I left it when I last lived there at eighteen. It's a shrine to my\nlong-vanished child-self, a garden gone to seed, a tangle of dusty paperbacks, knickknacks,\nand disheveled dolls. My mother refuses to throw anything away, although lately she's been\nurging me to come and weed things out myself.\n    \"I don't want to leave you with a mess to clean up when I die,\" she says. Now that we're\nmoving, she says, it's time.\n    Back in Boston for a visit, I shake open a large black trash bag and sit down on the floor\nof my old room. From a built-in cabinet, I exhume a postcard of Baryshnikov in midleap, a\nsilver-plated pendant in the shape of a Hershey's Kiss, faded mimeographs of high school\nclass songs and summer reading lists, stacks of letters, a flowered fabric-covered scrapbook\n(blank). I remember each of these objects perfectly, though I haven't thought of them in\nyears. I take a breath, open the trash bag, and stuff them in.\n    My mother comes in and perches on the edge of the bed. \"You don't need to throw\n<i>everything</i> away, you know,\" she says, reaching for a postcard with a cartoon of a girl with\ngoogly eyes on the front and my long-dead paternal grandmother's spidery handwriting on\nthe back. <i>My most beloved darling</i>. It's dated August 1970. I would have been seven then,\nthe same age as my daughter now. Will we be sitting together like this, looking at postcards\nfrom my own mother, when my daughter is forty-three?\n    My mother says, \"You know, you only need to get rid of those things you don't want to\nkeep.\"\n    What don't I want? I fish the pendant out of the trash bag, fingering the Kiss's paper\npull-tab, which reads \"I Love You,\" and which, amazingly, is still in tact. I give it to my\ndaughter, along with the scrapbook and a doll with floozy blond hair and tattered clothes,\nand pack them all into yet another box to be shipped to our new Ohio home. I retrieve the\nletters, the postcards, the mimeographs; I open the cabinet and put them back.\n    To my surprise my mother is satisfied with this. In fact she seems relieved. \"Everything\nwill be here for you whenever you want it,\" she says. ...\n\n- Margot Singer\nexcerpted from \"Afterimage\"\n<i>River Teeth</i>, Spring 2008",

The program\nincluded spraying home interiors with insecticides and distributing antimalarial drugs to\npeople in affected regions. But WHO's efforts yielded only partial success. The disease did\ndisappear in Europe, Russia, Australia and most of the Caribbean. South Asia initially saw\ndramatic reductions of infections, but the disease soon bounced back. Other hotspots fared\neven worse.\n    What went wrong? In a word, everything. The parasites fought back, becoming\nresistant to common medications.

              "content": "    ...Inspired by another successful eradication [of malaria] in Sardinia, in 1955 the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) inaugurated what was then the most ambitious campaign\nagainst disease in history, the Global Malaria Eradication Programme. The program\nincluded spraying home interiors with insecticides and distributing antimalarial drugs to\npeople in affected regions. But WHO's efforts yielded only partial success. The disease did\ndisappear in Europe, Russia, Australia and most of the Caribbean. South Asia initially saw\ndramatic reductions of infections, but the disease soon bounced back. Other hotspots fared\neven worse.\n    What went wrong? In a word, everything. The parasites fought back, becoming\nresistant to common medications. The mosquitoes grew stronger too, as more and more of\nthem were able to survive insecticides. In some climates, mosquitoes bred so quickly that\ninsecticide applications simply couldn't keep up. All the while, local tribes were waging wars\nof their own, which bogged down already-inadequate health infrastructures<sup>1</sup> and made public\nhealth interventions difficult and dangerous. In 1969, WHO shut down its program.\nNational malaria-control programs followed, but they later fell into neglect or were\nabandoned entirely. ...\n    Spraying insecticides isn't the only way to use them. Mosquito-repellent bed nets<sup>2</sup>\ntreated with a class of insecticides called pyrethroids, which bind more easily to nets than\nDDT,<sup>3</sup> cost just $1 to $2 apiece in Africa. And nets give some major bang for their buck: A\nstudy published last year found that a 10-fold increase in nets resulted in 44 percent fewer\ndeaths among Kenyan children in the studied areas. In September of 2006, Kenya's\ngovernment used a $17-million Global Fund grant to provide 3.4 million\ninsecticide-treated nets to children. Zambia followed its lead. In 2006, 23 percent of\nZambian children slept under treated nets, up from 1 percent in 2000. ...\n    In the face of widespread drug resistance, scientists have turned to a flowering shrub\ncalled wormwood (<i>Artemisia annua</i>), the active ingredient of which, artemisinin, has potent\nanti-fever properties. Since 2004, when WHO began promoting the use of artemisinin\nworldwide, the drug has proved to be extremely fast-acting and effective against\n<i>P. falciparum</i>.<sup>4</sup> WHO now recommends it or its derivatives as the first line of defense\nagainst the parasite in areas where chloroquine<sup>5</sup> no longer works, such as much of\nsub-Saharan Africa. Artemisinin is now one of the most powerful tools against malaria. ...\n    Fortunately, powerful synthetic versions of the drug are on the horizon. Since 2000,\npharmaceutical scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center have been working\non an entirely synthetic antimalarial designed to mimic artemisinin. In preclinical lab tests,\nthe drug, called OZ277, was found to be even more effective than artemisinin derivatives.\nThe medication is currently in the last stage of clinical trials and, although a price for the\ndrug has not been determined, it will probably be less expensive than artemisinin. ...\n    Complete eradication of malaria on the scale of polio will never be achieved without a\nvaccine. Creating that magic bullet, however, has been a tremendous challenge. Obstacles\ninclude the complexity of the parasites and their ability to quickly change and adapt. We\nalso don't completely understand our bodies' immune response to them. But a vaccine is\nfinally on the horizon. Over the past 25 years, the pharmaceutical company\nGlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has spent $300 million developing a malaria vaccine against\n<i>P. falciparum</i>. RTS,S, as it's called, helps the immune system fight off the parasites by\nblocking their ability to reproduce and develop in the liver, where they first arrive and\nmultiply. With grants from the Gates Foundation and other groups, the company recently\ntested RTS,S on humans. Last October [2007], the vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of\nmalarial infection by 65 percent among infants in Mozambique'a huge victory. ...\n\n- excerpted from \"How to End Malaria\"\n<i>Science Illustrated</i>, July/August 2008\n\n<sup>1</sup>infrastructure - underlying framework required for a system to work\n<sup>2</sup>bed nets - netting placed or hung around beds to prevent mosquitoes from biting sleepers\n<sup>3</sup>DDT - dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane, a powerful insecticide\n<sup>4</sup><i>P. falciparum</i> - the scientific name for the malaria parasite\n<sup>5</sup>chloroquine - an antimalarial drug",

              "content": "    To see me backpacking, you'd never know I'm the same woman whose blood pressure\nrises at the sight of crumbs on her kitchen counter. It's hard to imagine I rage against the\ndust bunnies and grit on my hardwood floor, when here in Yosemite's backcountry I sleep\non dirt, stir it into my oatmeal and shake it from my boots. My hair, skin and clothes\nthicken with grime each day. Filthy and blistered, I am happier than I have felt in years.\n    Perhaps it is the constant exertion that makes me so patient, content. After hauling a\npack stuffed with six days of food and gear up mountain passes, down steep ravines, and\nacross meadows, I find myself at sunset, hungry and worn to bliss. It's far from the exhaustion\nI feel after a grueling day teaching, paying bills, and cooking. No, this is purely\nphysical. My body aches for sleep, but my mind is as clear as the dusk light on Vogelsang\nLake. In this new place, I feel I've come home.\n    At the first light of dawn, I awake to scurry up rocks to watch the sunrise spread soft\npinks, then fiery yellow across the slate sky. In the meadow below me, two deer perk up\ntheir heads to scrutinize a sound on the wind. They begin running and I scan the fields\nexpecting to see a bear, wolf, or other reason for their flight. Seeing no animal, I wonder if\nthey're just running to run, something I rarely do. At home, I'm so busy trying to keep up\nwith my own expectations I'm always running towards something or from something. Here\nin Yosemite, there is no such pull. Clutched in the palm of these granite cathedrals, I'm in\nawe, a lithe<sup>1</sup> lupine<sup>2</sup> warming to the sun.\n    Perhaps this is why dirt in the wilderness never bothers me. I don't need to control it or\nmop it away. It's not my dirt or my husband's dirt to clean, but the soil for ponderosas,\nsequoias and tufts of mountain grass.

They all moved downstream in a ghostly procession,\nseparated by jagged black lines where the water was bare. The edges crunched when they\ntouched and hissed when they swept by. In the center of the river, where the current ran\nswifter, a band of floes moved much more quickly than those near the sides.\n    The moon was full, which would make the footing easier for Susan, for she must jump\nfrom floe to floe to cross the river. We stood alone-hand in hand at the edge of water, our\nskin separated by the wool of our mittens. No other eyes, no other soul, would watch her\ngo. Silence, stillness, cold. They chimed about us as one snowy chord. ...\n    When I saw Susan step upon the ice, I bit my lower lip till the blood flowed down my\nchin and crusted in the cold. Here the riverbank was no higher than a step, as from house\nto yard. In the moonlight, new snow like sugar glittered atop the sheet of ice lying along the\nbank. Behind her, in a lengthening path, Susan's footprints indented the sparkling snow. She\nmoved toward the center of the river as calmly as though crossing a broad\nmoonlit road cut through the brush and trees of the wilderness.\n    When she came to the first black edge, she stepped across the open water as though it\nwere a mere stream. The next floe was smaller, and the next even smaller; they dipped or\ntilted slightly when she stepped onto them. The spans of open water between them seemed\nwider and wider, and sometimes she waited for the current to bring the ice rafts closer\ntogether. Then she leapt the narrowed fissure and walked on. ...\n    As the current accelerated and the spaces between floes widened, Susan ran and\njumped from raft to raft; my heart hung in the air with her. In the center of the river, the\nswifter current zipped the ice rafts downstream, with Susan standing on one of them. Her\narms fluttered once for balance, twice. ...\n    At last the treacherous midsection of river was traversed. She was far from me\nnow-a dark upright using the flatness: flying and landing, running and leaping, from floe\nto floe. I saw shapes in the ice rafts, mostly like enormous animals, flat, not like a natural\nswan or bear but flat as a cookie animal or a tin weathervane. Near the other side,\napproaching a bend, she had to wait for her floe to come close to the bank. Holding the\nstitch<sup>2</sup> in my side, I continued walking as rapidly downstream as I could till I came to a high\nbut tangled shoreline that thwarted me. Soon the current would sweep Susan's floe beyond\nmy sight. <i>O, carry her close, carry her close, now,</i> I prayed to the ice, and I prayed that\nSusan would not feel herself passing beyond my sight and take the risk of trying to jump\nashore when the gulf remained too great. The floe that wheeled her toward the far shore\nwas like the palm of a hand, open and presentational.\n    Patient Susan! Her ice raft nudged the shore, and she jumped. Even as her shoes\nlanded on the snowy bank, she turned and looked exactly where I stood. Together we\nlifted our arms, blowing each other a kiss across the water, for we had not kissed on\nparting, saving it till she should be safe, and trusting the sweet air to be our go-between.\nAnd then one shout, though it was small from the distance, from Susan: <i>Freedom!</i>\n\n- Sena Jeter Naslund\nexcerpted from <i>Ahab's Wife</i>, 1999\nWilliam Morrow and Company, Inc.\n\n<sup>1</sup>floes - pieces of moving ice\n<sup>2</sup>stitch - sharp pain",

              "content": "    That night, Susan and I stood on the banks of the river, which was moving blackly with\nits load of white ice floes.<sup>1</sup> The floes were flat on the top and big as the floor of my cabin.\nSome were as big as a river barge. They all moved downstream in a ghostly procession,\nseparated by jagged black lines where the water was bare. The edges crunched when they\ntouched and hissed when they swept by. In the center of the river, where the current ran\nswifter, a band of floes moved much more quickly than those near the sides.\n    The moon was full, which would make the footing easier for Susan, for she must jump\nfrom floe to floe to cross the river. We stood alone-hand in hand at the edge of water, our\nskin separated by the wool of our mittens. No other eyes, no other soul, would watch her\ngo. Silence, stillness, cold. They chimed about us as one snowy chord. ...\n    When I saw Susan step upon the ice, I bit my lower lip till the blood flowed down my\nchin and crusted in the cold. Here the riverbank was no higher than a step, as from house\nto yard. In the moonlight, new snow like sugar glittered atop the sheet of ice lying along the\nbank. Behind her, in a lengthening path, Susan's footprints indented the sparkling snow. She\nmoved toward the center of the river as calmly as though crossing a broad\nmoonlit road cut through the brush and trees of the wilderness.\n    When she came to the first black edge, she stepped across the open water as though it\nwere a mere stream. The next floe was smaller, and the next even smaller; they dipped or\ntilted slightly when she stepped onto them. The spans of open water between them seemed\nwider and wider, and sometimes she waited for the current to bring the ice rafts closer\ntogether. Then she leapt the narrowed fissure and walked on. ...\n    As the current accelerated and the spaces between floes widened, Susan ran and\njumped from raft to raft; my heart hung in the air with her. In the center of the river, the\nswifter current zipped the ice rafts downstream, with Susan standing on one of them. Her\narms fluttered once for balance, twice. ...\n    At last the treacherous midsection of river was traversed. She was far from me\nnow-a dark upright using the flatness: flying and landing, running and leaping, from floe\nto floe. I saw shapes in the ice rafts, mostly like enormous animals, flat, not like a natural\nswan or bear but flat as a cookie animal or a tin weathervane. Near the other side,\napproaching a bend, she had to wait for her floe to come close to the bank. Holding the\nstitch<sup>2</sup> in my side, I continued walking as rapidly downstream as I could till I came to a high\nbut tangled shoreline that thwarted me.

              "content": "    The forest stretching out before us covers the mountain slopes with splashes of\nburgundies and yellows. The delicate hues melt into the blue sky like a runny watercolor\npainting. The colors match our expectations for autumn in the mountains, but the scale is\nout of kilter. Instead of towering trees, this forest barely reaches our knees.\n    On the tundra of Alaska's Denali National Park, the short growing season and long\nwinters stunt willow, birch and alder trees into pigmy forests. The abbreviated spring and\nsummer compresses the wildflower bloom into July, and the fall display of colors into the\nfirst two weeks of September. At high latitudes and high elevations, the seasons rush past\nlike a downhill skier. We can feel winter in the wind.\n    We first see a grizzly and her two cubs on a far ridge eating blueberries. The driver\nstops, and we crowd toward the right side of the shuttle bus. The bear slowly makes her way\nin our direction, the cubs following dutifully. Then one pauses to sniff something. The other\ntakes the opportunity to pounce, and the two roll and wrestle like playful kittens. The\nclicking cameras sound like approaching thunder.\n    The bears disappear in a woody depression. We wait. Suddenly, they reappear a few\nyards in front of the bus and cross the road. The 400-pound mother methodically raises a\nblueberry limb with her powerful claw and delicately nibbles off the ripe fruit while the\nwhimsical cubs entertain us with their antics.\n    \"I never dreamed we'd see anything this exciting,\" one woman whispers. \"I expected\nincredible scenery and wildlife, but only at a distance. This is like living with the bears.\" ...\n    The bears continue feeding and playing, aware but unconcerned about our presence as\nlong as we stay on the bus. Paradoxically, \"staying on the bus\" is the best, and perhaps the\nonly, relationship humans can have that preserves the wild. We feel a part of nature the\nmost when our presence affects it the least. ...\n    By the time we reach Eielson Visitors Center, Denali is socked in. As one of life's\nironies, something as ephemeral<sup>1</sup> as water vapor can completely obscure the most majestic\npeak in North America. The next 30 miles to Kantishna Roadhouse, our overnight lodge,\noffer unobstructed views of Denali, if only the clouds will lift. They tease us with glimpses,\nbut refuse to unmask the face of the mastiff. ...\n    We arrive just as streams of the September sun break through low clouds and\nilluminate the tops of the snow-covered peaks. Wisps of clouds hover over Denali like a\nmagician's cloak, but finally the crest is unveiled. Now I understand why the natives called\nthe mountain \"The High One.\" The peak looms a mile above its 15,000-foot neighbors.\n    The beauty of the scene transfixes us. As if on cue, a moose wades into the lake to\ncreate the perfect picture. The combination of wildlife and mountains epitomizes<sup>2</sup> the\nessence of pristine North America. We're presented with the gift of wilderness personified. ...\n    In Alaska, night doesn't fall, it rises. The tide of darkness creeps up the mountains\nslowly and engulfs the alpenglow<sup>3</sup> until only the peaks shine pink. One by one they blink\nout like fading beacons, until only Denali lights the sky.\n    Denali is not so much to be seen as felt. Elation from the power of the mountain surges\nthrough us. The mountain dwarfs any thoughts we have, any conception we can possess of\nits grandeur. It was and is and will be, while we mortals are as clouds sweeping past its face. ...\n\n- George Oxford Miller\nexcerpted from \"Denali\"\n<i>AAA Going Places</i>, September/October 2009\n\n<sup>1</sup>ephemeral - short-lived\n<sup>2</sup>epitomizes - is a typical example of\n<sup>3</sup>alpenglow - light seen near sunrise or sunset on the summits of mountains",

              "content": "    ...The man responsible for the layout and ambience of the modern shopping center was\nnot an American but a Viennese named Victor Gruen, who fled the Austrian Anschluss<sup>1</sup> in\n1938 and arrived in America with just $8 in his pocket. Within twelve years he had become\none of the country's leading urban planners. Ironically, Gruen's intention was not to create\na new and more efficient way of shopping but to recreate in America something of the\nunrushed cafe-society atmosphere of European city centers. Shopping centers-or\n<i>shopping towns</i>, as he preferred to call them-were to be gathering places for the\nneighborhood, focal points of the community where people could stroll and meet their\nfriends, dally over a coffee or an ice cream, and only incidentally shop. Gruen was\nconvinced that he was designing a system that would slow suburban sprawl and tame the\nautomobile. How wrong he was. ...\n    Shopping centers didn't just transform towns, they often effectively created them. In\nthe late 1940s, Paramus, New Jersey, was a dying little community with no high school, no\ndowntown to speak of, and almost no industry or offices. Then two shopping centers were\nbuilt along Route 4-Macy's Garden State Plaza and Allied Stores' Bergen Mall.

The King looked at my Vermont license plates through the greasy window and\nwiped his hands on his apron like he might have to reach for something.\n    I hadn't expected the place to be so grim, but even the weather had conspired with the\nshadowless November light. I was studying my road map, trying to find a way back to the\ninterstate without backtracking through town, and I had turned on the dome light so I could\nsee the thin numbered lines when a honey-dew green pickup pulled alongside mine.\n    A woman in the passenger seat rolled down the window with a dirty squawk, then\nleaned back in her seat, ramrod straight, as a man leaned over her, head out the window.\n    \"You lost?\" the man said. The woman sat stiffly, as though he had a foul smell or she had\nbeen seized by fear.\n    \"No, just trying to figure out which way to go from here. I know where I am-thanks\nfor asking,\" I said. ...\n    \"You must be lost,\" he said.\n    So I decided to explain. \"I'm looking up my family history-they're from around here,\nyears ago. Worley's the name. Know any Worleys?\"\n    \"I know Worleys.\"\n    \"Oh yeah? Probably distantly related. Think they'd talk to me?\" I hadn't actually\nplanned to look up anyone with the name, but it was a lead.\n    \"Talk to anyone,\" he said. Now the woman in the seat shifted uncomfortably and\nglanced quickly at me. Perhaps she knew Worleys too.\n    I asked him to introduce me to anyone named Worley, someone who might be able to\nfill in the gaps in my family tree. The day before I had tracked down an ancestor in the\ncounty courthouse archives, a many-great grandfather Daniel. There I made a photocopy\nof his 1836 will, a list of his worldly goods, which were spare and simple: a spinning wheel,\na splitting maul, two heifers.<sup>2</sup> His farm had been in this part of the county, and checking the\nphone book in the Roman Diner I had found a dozen Worleys listed in Pillar City.\n    I didn't explain all of this to the man and woman in the green truck, but they agreed to\nlead me to a house where some Worleys lived. I followed them down another road, a flat,\nwell-graveled route leading straight toward the Upper Tamark Creek. The road made a\nsharp bend at the banks of the creek, and the woman in the truck ahead of me stuck her\narm out of the window, pointing at a two-story frame house sheathed in gray stone halfway\nup. A man was in the side yard, weaving a riding lawnmower around stumps, an overturned\nrowboat, outbuildings, and the carcasses of nameless machines. All the man seemed to be\ndoing was mulching leaves. I pulled into the horseshoe driveway, a little uneasy that the\ngreen truck had not stopped and was now crossing the bridge over the Tamark. ...\n\n- Naton Leslie\nexcerpted from \"Lost\"\n<i>Marconi's Dream</i>, 2002\nTexas Review Press\n\n<sup>1</sup>anthracite - a hard coal\n<sup>2</sup>heifers - young cows",

              "content": "    The automobile and the motion picture industry are icons of American life. The two\nbecame the perfect match for inventor Richard M. Hollingshead Jr. when he combined\nthem and opened the first drive-in movie theater in Camden, New Jersey, in the summer\nof 1933.\n    Hollingshead somehow knew that this type of movie theater could eventually prove\nsuccessful, basing his assumption on the fact that a certain segment of the population never\nattended indoor movie houses. He felt confident that once his concept became a reality,\npeople would love the idea of watching movies from inside their automobiles, and he was\nright.\n    Families were drawn to drive-in movie theaters due in part to their convenience. More\nthan just a movie was offered to the ticket holder: There was no need to get all dressed up,\nyou didn't have to hire a babysitter, parking was included in the price of the ticket, and\ndinner was just a quick walk to the concession stand. Drive-ins also became popular with\nteenagers because it was the ideal place to take a date or socialize with \"the gang.\" What\ncould be better than dinner and a movie under the stars?\n    Toward the latter part of the 1930s, a depressed economy and a world war were just two\nof the reasons for the somewhat slow development of drive-in movie theaters. All of that\nwould change by the mid-1940s.\n    After the war, America flourished. With a booming economy, hoards of families flocked\nto the suburbs. The setting was perfect for the success of drive-ins. There was plenty of\naffordable, available land and the \"car culture\" in America was just beginning.\n    The 1950s was the golden age for drive-in movie theaters. More than 4,600 were\nopened for business during the prosperous and defining decade of the baby boom. To lure\nin the family trade, playgrounds were built for children while live bands entertained adults.\nNever mind that the movies were second-rate as was the sound quality-it was the\n\"drive-in experience\" that kept moviegoers coming back for more.\n    As the decade neared an end, so did the popularity of going to the drive-in. By the\nmid-1960s and well into the 1970s, \"the drive-in experience\" had become somewhat\ntiresome. The inferior quality of the movies being shown combined with the antiquated\nsound system led many customers back to indoor theaters.\n    During the 1980s more and more drive-ins began closing down for good. Many owners\njumped at the chance to sell their lots to land developers as a means of getting out of\na sagging business. ...\n    Yet with all its adversity and struggle, the drive-in movie theater has endured. It has\nwithstood the test of time and has become a symbol for a public that is not quite ready to\ngive up on its nostalgic past.\n    Today many drive-ins appear to be enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Owners and\noperators, taking pride in their establishments, are now offering Dolby sound along with\nfirst-run movie releases. What began as the idea of one man in Camden, New Jersey, has\nbecome a cultural icon for over half a century. Drive-in movie theaters have been and\nalways will be part of the American landscape.\n\n- Elizabeth McKeon and Linda Everett\nexcerpted from <i>Cinema Under the Stars</i>, 1998\nCumberland House",

Keeping the heat low, he stared intently at the pan. Nothing happened. After a long\nthree minutes, the eggs began to thicken into a custard.

Recent\ndata show the average atmospheric temperature has increased about 4.5 degrees\nFahrenheit in the western Antarctic Peninsula since the 1940s, making the region, along\nwith northwestern North America and Siberia, among the fastest warming on earth. This\njump has been implicated in the recent collapse of major ice shelves along the Antarctic\nPeninsula, including the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008. As a result, thousands of new icebergs\nhave calved, or broken off, from ice shelves into the Southern Ocean at an accelerated rate.\n    Even as more icebergs are being created, scientists are learning that these\ndangerous beauties are far from sterile, inert masses of ice. In fact, they dramatically alter\ntheir environments biologically, chemically, and physically, making them islands of life in\nthe open sea. Knowledge of icebergs' crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem has come only\nin recent years. Observers at sea had long remarked that they attract seals, penguins, and\nseabirds, and divers had noticed that fish are more numerous near them than in the\nsurrounding sea.

During their existence-typically years from calving from an Antarctic or\nGreenlandic glacier to their gradual melting as they drift into lower latitudes-they support\nanimals on, around, even <i>inside</i> their magnificent ramparts. They fertilize the ocean with\nnutrients, boosting plankton production. Grounded bergs can shelter areas of the seafloor,\nprotecting bottom-dwelling creatures from free-floating icebergs, which can be\nbottom-scouring marauders, furrowing the seabed at depths of more than a thousand feet\nlike gigantic plows, destroying all marine life unable to move out of the way.

On those days we'd stay inside, cleaning, ironing,\nand cooking up huge pots of gumbo. I'd climb up onto the big soft chair next to the\nfireplace in the kitchen, and shine shoes or sew on buttons or do the other tasks she was\nteaching me. I'd sit there and watch her work, watch her go in and out of the washroom like\na breeze was blowing her in.\n    On hot Days of Beauty, we'd put on our swimsuits and stand outside on the wooden\nplatform of the outdoor shower. It was my happy job to scrub clean buckets and other\ncontainers and set them outside to gather rainwater to wash our hair. M'Dear would undo\nmy braid, pour the rainwater on my head, put on a little Breck shampoo, and wash my hair.\nThe sun shone down, my mother's hands touched my head, and her fingers lathered love\ninto me. Never has my hair been so soft. Sometimes I still wash my hair in rainwater, to\nremember.\n    After our hair was clean, M'Dear would leave hers down, and, still in our swimsuits,\nwe'd hang clean clothes outside to dry on the line, with me handing her clothespins out of\na small apron she had sewn for me out of flower sacks. I have a photo of us by the\nclothesline, doing this very thing. We were working and smiling, squinting slightly in the\nsunlight. I was just about to enter first grade, just about to leave behind those motherdaughter\ndays of intimacy, of little maternal baptisms. M'Dear prepared me for that leaving\nso that it was smooth and felt natural. Not all leavings are that easily prepared for.\n    After finishing chores and when our hair was dry, M'Dear and I would go down to our\npier, just before sunset. These memories are so vivid to me that I don't need a photograph\nto see them. I carry them inside me.\n    In one memory, it is growing toward twilight. We are sitting on the pier with the La\nLuna River flowing by. ...\n    And as the sun sparkled off the cocoa-red water and the wind stirred in the tall pines,\nI stood behind my mother, my legs on either side of her, and brushed her hair. I lifted her\nlong chestnut hair up off her neck, twirled it up on top of her head, then let it fall,\nwatching its weight settle back down and around her shoulders. Then I'd lean my face into\nher hair and smell it. I can close my eyes and smell it now: sun and vanilla.\n    What I first learned about love, I learned on that dock with M'Dear. The La Luna River\nflowing by with its river sounds, the riverbanks with their lovely sweet citrus scent of\njasmine, the scent of M'Dear's hair, the oils of her scalp, the fullness of her thick, long curls\nagainst my hands, our breathing together, the closeness, her love for me-all of this knit my\nsoul together.

Backus pretended to buy\na car, rent an apartment, and apply for a credit card. Then, she and her classmates played\nthe \"stock market game,\" investing the hypothetical earnings from their hypothetical jobs\nin the market in the fateful fall of 2008. \"Our pretend investments crashed,\" Backus says,\nstill horrified. \"We felt what actual shareholders were feeling.\"\n    That pain of earning and losing money is a feeling that public schools increasingly want\nto teach. Forty states now offer some type of financial instruction at the elementary or\nhigh-school level, embedding lessons in balancing checkbooks and buying stock into math\nand social-studies classes. Though it's too early to measure the full impact of the Great\nRecession, anecdotally the interest in personal-finance classes has risen since 2007 when\nsubprime became a four-letter word and bank failures a regular occurrence. Now, a handful\nof states including Missouri, Utah, and Tennessee require teenagers to take financial literacy\nclasses to graduate from high school. School districts such as Chicago are boosting\ntheir offerings in money-management classes for kids as young as elementary school, and\nroughly 300 colleges or universities now offer online personal-finance classes for incoming\nstudents. \"These classes really say, 'This is how you live independently,'\" says Ted Beck,\npresident of National Endowment for Financial Education.\n    Rather than teach investment strategies or financial wizardry, these courses offer a backto-\nthe-basics approach to handling money: Don't spend what you don't have. Put part of\nyour monthly salary into a savings account, and invest in the stock market for the long-term\nrather than short-term gains. For Backus, this means dividing her earnings from her\npart-time job at a fast-food restaurant into separate envelopes for paying bills, spending,\nand saving. \"Money is so hard to make but so easy to spend,\" she says one weekday after\nschool. \"That was the big takeaway.\"\n    Teaching kids about the value of cash certainly is one of the programs' goals, but teachers\nalso want students to think hard about their finances long term. It's easy for teenagers to get\nriled up about gas prices because many of them drive cars. But the hard part is urging them\nto put off the instant gratification of buying a new T shirt or an iPod. \"Investing and retirement\naren't things teenagers are thinking about. For them, the future is this weekend,\" says Gayle\nWhitefield, a business and marketing teacher at Utah's Riverton High School. ...\n    That's a big goal for these classes: preventing kids from making the same financial\nmissteps their parents did when it comes to saving, spending, and debt. Though the\npersonal savings rate has shot up to 4.2 percent as of July 2009, that's still a far distance from\n1982, when Americans saved 11.2 percent of their incomes. It's hard for schools to teach\nstrict money-management skills when teenagers go home and watch their parents rack up\ncredit-card debt. It's like telling your kids not to smoke and then lighting up a cigarette in\nfront of them, Beck says. ...\n    Even with these challenges, students such as Backus say learning about money in school\nis worthwhile. After Backus finished her financial-literacy class, she opened up a savings\naccount at her local bank and started to think more about how she and her family would pay\nfor college. \"She just has a better understanding of money and how it affects the world,\"\nsays her mother, Darleen-and that's down to the minutiae<sup>1</sup> of how money is spent at-large\nfrom taxes to bank bailouts to the federal government's deficit.

It's easy for teenagers to get\nriled up about gas prices because many of them drive cars.

Though the\npersonal savings rate has shot up to 4.2 percent as of July 2009, that's still a far distance from\n1982, when Americans saved 11.2 percent of their incomes. It's hard for schools to teach\nstrict money-management skills when teenagers go home and watch their parents rack up\ncredit-card debt. It's like telling your kids not to smoke and then lighting up a cigarette in\nfront of them, Beck says. ...\n    Even with these challenges, students such as Backus say learning about money in school\nis worthwhile.

If you walked out there, you had to go through the big\npasture by the north pond. That pasture had tall fescue grass you had to wade through. If\nyou sat down, the horizon vanished, the trees on the edge of the field vanished. You could\nsee just a few feet into the grass, and you could see sky. That was all. You could flatten down\nthe grass to make a little sitting area. You could make a path to another sitting area and have\ntwo sitting areas and a path. Of course, once the grass was cut for hay, there'd be no more\nof that kind of thing. The grass on the front hill was the same.\n    They were wild blackberries. Picking them was fun for about the first twelve berries,\nthen it was work, but you were allowed to eat as many as you wanted. Fresh blackberries\nmeant you got a cobbler for dinner. You could also put them on your cereal with honey. The\nsecond day, maybe we would crumble hot biscuits into bowls, then sprinkle them with\nberries, then add milk or cream, then add honey. It was almost the best thing a person could\neat. There was no name for it, so when you wanted it you had to say the whole thing:\n\"Biscuits with berries on them and then milk and honey in a bowl.\" It was a breakfast or a\ndessert for lunch or dinner or a snack for after dinner or night. That's what it was. It was all\nof that.\n    The brambles would scratch you when you were picking berries. Like how a kitten\nscratches you on your arms, even though they don't mean it. Also, there were ticks,\nchiggers and poison ivy. The hazards of the blackberry patch. You never saw any snakes out\nthere, but for some reason you were always told that there might be snakes. A watchful eye\nwas required.\n    It felt like a long way from the house, even though you could look across the pastures\nand see the house on the hill, residing in the elm shade. Still, it felt like you were really out\nsomewhere. You knew the creek was not too far away. You couldn't hear any roads from\nthere. If you looked up, maybe there was a jet making a line in the sky. Not that you could\nsee the actual jet, just the line.\n    Before blackberry month, there were trips to pick strawberries at strawberry farms. For\nabout three days you ate as many strawberries as humanly possible. The rest had to be\ncleaned, sliced, sugared and frozen. Then there were trips to go pick blueberries. And then\nyou ate as many of them as humanly possible. The rest had to be cleaned and frozen. Or\ncanned. Canning happened at night because it was too hot to do during the day and it\nhelped a lot if Dad was home to pitch in. The shadows slanted across the yard.\nThe shadows slanted across the garden. A horsefly droned past, on his way to\nsomewhere else. The barn swallows swooped and banked above the horse pasture. They\nspiraled, dove. Their forked tails.\nOne flew right between the legs of the horse. You saw it...\n\n- Jeremy Jackson\nexcerpted from \"Food, Animals\"\nThe Missouri Review, Spring/Summer 2005",

              "content": "    From San Francisco to New York to Paris, city governments, high-class restaurants,\nschools, and religious groups are ditching bottled water in favor of what comes out of the\nfaucet. With people no longer content to pay 1,000 times as much for bottled water, a\nproduct no better than water from the tap, a backlash against bottled water is growing.\n    The U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents some 1,100 American cities,\ndiscussed at its June 2007 meeting the irony of purchasing bottled water for city employees\nand for city functions while at the same time touting<sup>1</sup> the quality of municipal water. The\ngroup passed a resolution sponsored by Mayors Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, Rocky\nAnderson of Salt Lake City, and R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis that called for the examination\nof bottled water's environmental impact. The resolution noted that with $43 billion a year\ngoing to provide clean drinking water in cities across the country, the United States\nmunicipal water systems are among the finest in the world.\n    Tap water promotional campaigns would have seemed quaint a few decades ago, when\nwater in bottles was a rarity. Now such endeavors are needed to counteract the pervasive<sup>2</sup>\nmarketing that has caused consumers to lose faith in the faucet. In fact, more than a quarter\nof bottled water is just processed tap water, including top-selling Aquafina and Coca-Cola's\nDasani. When Pepsi announced in July [2007] that it would clearly label its Aquafina water\nas from a \"public water source,\" it no doubt shocked everyone who believed that\nbottles with labels depicting pristine mountains or glaciers delivered a superior product. ...\n    With sales growing by 10 percent each year, far faster than any other beverage, bottled\nwater now appears to be the drink of choice for many Americans they swallow more of it\nthan milk, juice, beer, coffee, or tea. While some industry analysts are counting on bottled\nwater to beat out carbonated soft drinks to top the charts in the near future, the\nburgeoning<sup>3</sup> back-to-the-tap movement may reverse the trend.\n    In contrast to tap water, which is delivered through an energy-efficient infrastructure,\nbottled water is an incredibly wasteful product. It is usually packaged in single-serving\nplastic bottles made with fossil fuels. Just manufacturing the 29 billion plastic bottles used\nfor water in the United States each year requires the equivalent of more than 17 million\nbarrels of crude oil.\n    After being filled, the bottles may travel far. Nearly one quarter of bottled water\ncrosses national borders before reaching consumers, and part of the cachet<sup>4</sup> of certain\nbottled water brands is their remote origin. Adding in the Pacific Institute's estimates for\nthe energy used for pumping and processing, transportation, and refrigeration, brings the\nannual fossil fuel footprint of bottled water consumption in the United States to over 50\nmillion barrels of oil equivalent enough to run 3 million cars for one year. If everyone\ndrank as much bottled water as Americans do, the world would need the equivalent of more\nthan 1 billion barrels of oil to produce close to 650 billion individual bottles. ...\n    Slowing sales may be the wave of the future as the bottle boycott movement picks up\nspeed. With more than 1 billion people around the globe still lacking access to a safe and\nreliable source of water, the $100 billion the world spends on bottled water every year could\ncertainly be put to better use creating and maintaining safe public water infrastructure\neverywhere.\n\n- Janet Larsen\nexcerpted from \"Bottled Water Boycotts: Back-to-the-Tap\nMovement Gains Momentum\"\nwww.earthpolicy.org, December 7, 2007\n\n<sup>1</sup> touting - praising or publicizing loudly or extravagantly\n<sup>2</sup> pervasive - tends to become diffused throughout every part\n<sup>3</sup> burgeoning - growing rapidly\n<sup>4</sup> cachet - influential status",

              "content": "    I was lucky enough to discover my passion for flying when I was very young, and to\n    indulge that passion day after day. Lucky that some things went my way; my eyesight, for\n    instance, was good enough to allow me to become a fighter pilot. And lucky that when I left \nthe military, I found work as an airline pilot, when such jobs weren't plentiful. \n    I still feel fortunate, after all these years, to be able to follow my passion. The airline \nindustry has its problems, and a lot of the issues can be troubling and wearying, but I still \nfind purpose and satisfaction in flying. \n    There's a literal freedom you feel when you're at the controls, gliding above the surface \nof the earth, no longer bound by gravity. It's as if you're rising above the nitty-gritty details \nof life. Even at a few thousand feet, you get a wider perspective. Problems that loom large \ndown below feel smaller from that height, and smaller still by the time you reach thirty-five \nthousand feet. \n    I love that flying is an intellectual challenge, and that there's mental math that needs to \nbe done all along the way. If you change the angle of the nose versus the horizon by even \none degree while traveling at a typical commercial airliner speed of seven nautical miles a \nminute, it's enough to increase or decrease your rate of climb or descent by seven hundred \nfeet per minute. I enjoy keeping track of all the calculations, staying aware of the weather \nconditions, working with a team-flight attendants, air traffic controllers, first officers, \nmaintenance crews-while knowing intimately what the plane can and cannot do.

It was\nfound a century later, under 30 feet of silt a little north of Omaha, Neb[raska].\n    Among the canned food items retrieved from the Bertrand in 1968 were brandied\npeaches, oysters, plum tomatoes, honey, and mixed vegetables. In 1974, chemists at the\nNational Food Processors Association (NFPA) analyzed the products for bacterial \ncontamination and nutrient value. Although the food had lost its fresh smell and \nappearance, the NFPA chemists detected no microbial growth and determined that the\nfoods were as safe to eat as they had been when canned more than 100 years earlier. ...\n    Canned foods are more than a relic dug from the past. They make up 12 percent of \ngrocery sales in the United States. More than 1,500 food products are canned-including\nmany that aren't available fresh in most areas, such as elderberry, guava, mango, and about\n75 different juice drinks. Consumers can buy at least 130 different canned vegetable \nproducts-from artichokes and asparagus to turnips and zucchini. More than a dozen kinds\nof beef are canned, including beef burgers and chopped, corned and barbecued beef. ...\n    Food-spoiling bacteria, yeasts and molds are naturally present in foods. To grow, these\nmicroorganisms need moisture, a low-acid environment (acid prevents bacterial growth),\nnutrients, and an appropriate (usually room) temperature.\n    Dennis Dignan, Ph.D., chief of FDA's [Food and Drug Administration's] food processing\nsection, explains that foods are preserved from food spoilage by controlling one or more of\nthe above factors. For instance, frozen foods are stored at temperatures too low for \nmicroorganisms (bacteria, yeasts and molds) to grow. When foods are dried, sufficient \nmoisture is not available to promote growth.\n    It is the preservation process that distinguishes canned from other packaged foods.\nDuring canning, the food is placed in an airtight (hermetically sealed) container and heated\nto destroy microorganisms. The hermetic seal is essential to ensure that microorganisms do\nnot contaminate the product after it is sterilized through heating, says Dignan. Properly\ncanned foods can be stored unrefrigerated indefinitely without fear of their spoiling or\nbecoming toxic. ...\n    Dignan also notes that foods packaged in materials other than metal cans are considered\n\"canned\" by food processing specialists if the food undergoes the canning preservation\nprocess. Thus, today a canned food may be packaged in a number of other types of \ncontainers, such as glass jars, paperboard cans, and plastics that can be formed into anything\nfrom pouches to soup bowls to serving trays. ...\n    Foods with a naturally high acid content-such as tomatoes, citrus juices, pears, and\nother fruits-will not support the growth of food poisoning bacteria. In tests, when large\nnumbers of food poisoning bacteria are added to these foods, the bacteria die within a day.\n(The exact amount of time depends upon the bacteria and amount of acidity.) Foods that\nhave a high acid content, therefore, do not receive as extreme a heat treatment as low-acid\nfoods. They are heated sufficiently to destroy bacteria, yeasts and molds that could cause\nfood to spoil. ...\n    Low-acid canned foods receive a high dose of heat-usually 107 degrees Celsius \n(250 degrees Fa[h]renheit) for at least three minutes. (The amount of time the food is heat-\ned, though, depends upon the size of the container and the product.) The canned food \nis heated in a retort, a kind of pressure cooker. ...\n    Another critical element in the canned food process is sealing products in airtight \ncontainers. It is essential that air be removed from the container before sealing. Air could\ncause the can to expand during heating, perhaps damaging the seals or seams of the \ncontainer.\n    A telltale sign of loss of this vacuum<sup>1</sup> -and a possibly contaminated product-is a can\nwith bulging ends. If a seal is not airtight, bacteria may enter the can, multiply, and \ncontaminate the product. ...\n\n- Dale Blumenthal\nexcerpted and adapted from \"The Canning Process\"\n<i>FDA Consumer</i>, September 1990\n\n<sup>1</sup>vacuum - an airtight seal",

              "content": "    The steamboat Bertrand was heavily laden with provisions when it set out on the\nMissouri River in 1865, destined for the gold mining camps in Fort Benton, Mont[ana]. The\nboat snagged and swamped under the weight, sinking to the bottom of the river. It was\nfound a century later, under 30 feet of silt a little north of Omaha, Neb[raska].\n    Among the canned food items retrieved from the Bertrand in 1968 were brandied\npeaches, oysters, plum tomatoes, honey, and mixed vegetables. In 1974, chemists at the\nNational Food Processors Association (NFPA) analyzed the products for bacterial \ncontamination and nutrient value. Although the food had lost its fresh smell and \nappearance, the NFPA chemists detected no microbial growth and determined that the\nfoods were as safe to eat as they had been when canned more than 100 years earlier. ...\n    Canned foods are more than a relic dug from the past. They make up 12 percent of \ngrocery sales in the United States. More than 1,500 food products are canned-including\nmany that aren't available fresh in most areas, such as elderberry, guava, mango, and about\n75 different juice drinks. Consumers can buy at least 130 different canned vegetable \nproducts-from artichokes and asparagus to turnips and zucchini. More than a dozen kinds\nof beef are canned, including beef burgers and chopped, corned and barbecued beef. ...\n    Food-spoiling bacteria, yeasts and molds are naturally present in foods. To grow, these\nmicroorganisms need moisture, a low-acid environment (acid prevents bacterial growth),\nnutrients, and an appropriate (usually room) temperature.\n    Dennis Dignan, Ph.D., chief of FDA's [Food and Drug Administration's] food processing\nsection, explains that foods are preserved from food spoilage by controlling one or more of\nthe above factors. For instance, frozen foods are stored at temperatures too low for \nmicroorganisms (bacteria, yeasts and molds) to grow. When foods are dried, sufficient \nmoisture is not available to promote growth.\n    It is the preservation process that distinguishes canned from other packaged foods.\nDuring canning, the food is placed in an airtight (hermetically sealed) container and heated\nto destroy microorganisms. The hermetic seal is essential to ensure that microorganisms do\nnot contaminate the product after it is sterilized through heating, says Dignan. Properly\ncanned foods can be stored unrefrigerated indefinitely without fear of their spoiling or\nbecoming toxic. ...\n    Dignan also notes that foods packaged in materials other than metal cans are considered\n\"canned\" by food processing specialists if the food undergoes the canning preservation\nprocess. Thus, today a canned food may be packaged in a number of other types of \ncontainers, such as glass jars, paperboard cans, and plastics that can be formed into anything\nfrom pouches to soup bowls to serving trays. ...\n    Foods with a naturally high acid content-such as tomatoes, citrus juices, pears, and\nother fruits-will not support the growth of food poisoning bacteria. In tests, when large\nnumbers of food poisoning bacteria are added to these foods, the bacteria die within a day.\n(The exact amount of time depends upon the bacteria and amount of acidity.) Foods that\nhave a high acid content, therefore, do not receive as extreme a heat treatment as low-acid\nfoods. They are heated sufficiently to destroy bacteria, yeasts and molds that could cause\nfood to spoil. ...\n    Low-acid canned foods receive a high dose of heat-usually 107 degrees Celsius \n(250 degrees Fa[h]renheit) for at least three minutes. (The amount of time the food is heat-\ned, though, depends upon the size of the container and the product.) The canned food \nis heated in a retort, a kind of pressure cooker. ...\n    Another critical element in the canned food process is sealing products in airtight \ncontainers. It is essential that air be removed from the container before sealing. Air could\ncause the can to expand during heating, perhaps damaging the seals or seams of the \ncontainer.\n    A telltale sign of loss of this vacuum<sup>1</sup> -and a possibly contaminated product-is a can\nwith bulging ends. If a seal is not airtight, bacteria may enter the can, multiply, and \ncontaminate the product. ...\n\n- Dale Blumenthal\nexcerpted and adapted from \"The Canning Process\"\n<i>FDA Consumer</i>, September 1990\n\n<sup>1</sup>vacuum - an airtight seal",

It was wet with river water, and it caught the noon light like fire in her hand.\n    \"The children found it,\" she said. \"I was digging for roots.\" Norliza was a midwife,\nknown in the village for her skill with herbs and massage. She came into the jungle every\nweek to search for the healing roots and bark. \"I was digging there, near the trees by the\nriver.

The call to prayer wavered from the village mosque, and it\nseemed to Muda that he could see it, waves of sound shimmering concurrently with the\nmidday heat. It was the end of the fruit season, one of the last hot weeks before the rains\nbegan, and the weather was a fiery hand against his back. Muda walked with his straw hat\npulled down low over his forehead, so he didn't see the children running toward him until\nthey were quite near. They circled around him and pulled in close, like the petals on a closing\nflower.\n    \"Pachik Muda.\" It was his oldest nephew, a boy named Amin. He was wearing shorts\nand holding the hand of his youngest sister, Maimunah, who stood brown and naked beside\nhim. \"Uncle, our mother says for you to come quickly to the river.\" ...\n    \"Tell your mother,\" he said, \"that I will come later. Right now I am going for my lunch.\"\nHe expected them to run off then. They were the children of his sister, Norliza, and they\nwere rarely naughty. But instead Amin released his sister's hand. He reached out and\ntugged at Muda's sarong.<sup>2</sup>\n    \"My mother says to come,\" he repeated. \"Please, Pachik Muda, she says it is important.\"\n    Muda sighed then, but he turned and followed the children back along the road. Red\nrambutans<sup>3</sup> and smooth green mangoes hung from the trees. He plucked some of these and\nate them as he walked, wondering what he would find on the riverbank. Norliza had worked\nthe rubber too, before she married, and she would not take him lightly from his rest and\nprayers.\n    When he reached the river he saw a cluster of women standing on the grassy bank.\nNorliza was in the center, her sarong wet to the knees, holding something out for the \nothers to see.\n    \"Norliza,\" he called. He was going to scold her for consuming his time with her bit of\nwoman's nonsense, but before he could speak she ran to him and uncurled her fist. The\nlines in her palm were creased with dirt, so that the skin around them looked very pale. The\nwords he had planned stopped in his mouth. For on her palm lay a piece of gold as large as\na knuckle. It was wet with river water, and it caught the noon light like fire in her hand.\n    \"The children found it,\" she said. \"I was digging for roots.\" Norliza was a midwife,\nknown in the village for her skill with herbs and massage. She came into the jungle every\nweek to search for the healing roots and bark. \"I was digging there, near the trees by the\nriver. The children were playing next to me, sorting out the rocks for a game. This one they\nliked because of its shine. At first I did not realize. It was only when Amin washed it in the\nriver that I understood.\" Her dark eyes gleamed with an unfamiliar excitement. \"To think,\"\nshe said. \"To think he might have dropped it, and I would never have known.\"\n    Muda reached out and took the knot of gold. It was smooth, almost soft, against his \nfingers. He ran his thumb against it again and again. Some of the women drew close to\nstare. Others, he noticed, were already moving away with the news. ...\n\n- Kim Edwards\nexcerpted from \"Gold\"\n<i>The Secrets of a Fire King, </i>1997\nW. W.

They\noften took shape first as scenes that Rockwell literally acted out, not only for his editors at\nthe [<i>Saturday Evening</i>] <i>Post </i>, but his real-life models, too. \"It was strenuous,\" he once\nexplained, \"but I felt it was the best way to get across my meaning.\" And so he would \nenthusiastically play out his visions and ideas, a one-man show packed with just the right\nexpressions, giving enough details of each persona in the scene to inspire his models and,\nmore importantly, get his editors to buy his ideas.\n    Now, more than 30 years after his death, Rockwell is still acknowledged for deftly<sup>1</sup>\nchronicling the best of 20th century American life with vignettes<sup>2</sup> of simple emotions\nevoked by everyday people. This phenomenon is a resounding testament to Rockwell's\nprowess as a storyteller and is the subject of another kind of one-man show: the upcoming\nexhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., titled Telling\nStories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The\nexhibit, assembled from the private collections of these two popular film directors, will \nfeature rarely viewed pieces of Rockwell's work, including George Lucas' favorite, \n<i> Lands of Enchantment</i>, which shows a youngster imagining himself as an armor-clad knight riding\naway with a beautiful girl. The point is not the boy reading, but how the book inspires the\nboy's imagination, taking him, in idealized form, to another time and place. ...\n    \"Storytelling was very important to Norman Rockwell,\" says Lucas. \"Every image has\neither the middle or the end of a story, and you can already see the beginning even though\nit's not there. You can see all the missing parts of the story because he took that one frame\nthat sort of tells you everything you need to know.\n    \"And, of course, in filmmaking we strive for that. We strive to get images that convey,\nvisually, a lot of information without having to spend a lot of time at it. Norman Rockwell\nwas a master at that-he was a master at telling a story in one frame,\" explains Lucas.\n    That concentration of information as well as emotion is something inherent<sup>3</sup> in\nRockwell's art. Emotion certainly spoke to Steven Spielberg when he first saw one of his\nfavorite Rockwell paintings, <i>High Dive</i>, the August 16, 1947 <i>Post</i> cover that depicts a boy\nat the top of what must be (or so we imagine from the boy's expression) a towering diving\nboard. He crouches high above a swimming pool, too afraid to either jump or climb back\ndown. The painting hangs in Spielberg's office at Amblin Entertainment because it holds a\ngreat deal of meaning for the filmmaker. ...\n    Even in the creation of their work, Spielberg and Rockwell were more similar than is\nimmediately evident. To create his meticulously detailed recollections of everyday\nAmerican life, Rockwell worked much like a film director, not just acting out the scenes in his\nimagination, but scouting locations, casting everyday people from his town for particular\nparts, choosing costumes and props, and directing his performers to make them instantly\nfamiliar to the public. Little wonder then, that filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, as well\nas others, should be so inspired by his work.\n    In directing his own scenes, Rockwell had a specific focus, just not one based on the\nstark realism in which he grew up. Instead, Rockwell aimed to depict life in a kind of \nrealistic fantasy.

The point is not the boy reading, but how the book inspires the\nboy's imagination, taking him, in idealized form, to another time and place. ...\n    \"Storytelling was very important to Norman Rockwell,\" says Lucas. \"Every image has\neither the middle or the end of a story, and you can already see the beginning even though\nit's not there. You can see all the missing parts of the story because he took that one frame\nthat sort of tells you everything you need to know.\n    \"And, of course, in filmmaking we strive for that. We strive to get images that convey,\nvisually, a lot of information without having to spend a lot of time at it. Norman Rockwell\nwas a master at that-he was a master at telling a story in one frame,\" explains Lucas.\n    That concentration of information as well as emotion is something inherent<sup>3</sup> in\nRockwell's art.

He crouches high above a swimming pool, too afraid to either jump or climb back\ndown. The painting hangs in Spielberg's office at Amblin Entertainment because it holds a\ngreat deal of meaning for the filmmaker. ...\n    Even in the creation of their work, Spielberg and Rockwell were more similar than is\nimmediately evident. To create his meticulously detailed recollections of everyday\nAmerican life, Rockwell worked much like a film director, not just acting out the scenes in his\nimagination, but scouting locations, casting everyday people from his town for particular\nparts, choosing costumes and props, and directing his performers to make them instantly\nfamiliar to the public. Little wonder then, that filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, as well\nas others, should be so inspired by his work.\n    In directing his own scenes, Rockwell had a specific focus, just not one based on the\nstark realism in which he grew up.

              "content": "    Elizabeth Blake suspended three flint blades from a small wooden frame. Holding her\ncell phone in one hand, she took a piece of antler in the other and gently struck each blade\nonce. Over a bad transatlantic connection, our phone conversation had been difficult, but\nthe tones from the four-inch-long blades came through-clear, sweet, and crystalline.<sup>1</sup> They\nsounded like hand bells or struck goblets. The blades are replicas of 30,000-year-old \nartifacts from the sites of Isturitz in the French Pyrenees and Geißenklösterle in \nsouthwestern Germany.\n    Blake, who is the granddaughter of an opera singer and the daughter of a pianist, is an\narchaeology graduate student at Cambridge University. One of the newest members of a\ndeveloping sub-discipline, the archaeology of music, she is basing her research on the\nhypothesis that our earliest ancestors discovered and enjoyed a peculiar property of some\nstone tools-they rang. ...\n    The major difficulty that prehistoric musicologists face is that it's so easy to make music\nwithout leaving a trace. In addition to dancing and singing, hunter-gatherer cultures used\nnatural materials to create instruments. Native Americans shook rattles made from gourds.\nAustralian aborigines played instruments called didgeridoos fashioned from huge tree limbs\nor bamboo. The San of southwest Africa plucked the gut strings of their wooden hunting\nbows. What are the odds these would survive for thousands of years to be found (let alone\ncorrectly identified) by an archaeologist? The best anyone can expect to discover is when\nhumans first began to create reliable and durable instruments.\n    Graeme Lawson, an independent archaeologist in England who heads a multidisciplinary<sup>2</sup>\norganization known as Cambridge Music-Archaeological Research believes that some\nobjects now on display in museums may actually be misidentified musical artifacts. One\ncase in point is a medieval \"garment clasp\" that was made from a pig knuckle. Lawson \nanalyzed the wear patterns and polish around a hole that had been drilled through the \ncenter of the bone and showed they were consistent with the patterns found on \"buzz\nbones,\" a type of noise maker that was used as a children's toy in some parts of Europe until\na few decades ago. When the knuckle bone was tied to a string and whirled through the air,\nit would have made an eerie, ghostlike sound.\n    How many ancient objects now labeled as \"garment clasps\" were actually used as noise\nmakers? How many flint artifacts doubled as chimes? There's plenty for an avid music\narchaeologist to do without ever touching a spade.\n    The oldest indisputably musical artifacts are flutes (experts call them \"pipes\") made\nfrom the bones of birds. They come from two sites, Isturitz and Geißenklösterle. The pipes\nwere found in excavation levels associated with Europe's earliest modern human \npopulation, the Aurignacian culture. The people at these sites created jewelry, made \npaintings, and crafted sculptures that represented human figures, showing that music was\njust one part of an artistic revolution that started in Africa more than 100,000 years ago and\nwas brought to Europe by anatomically modern humans around 40,000 years ago. ...\n    What does survive, of course, is stone. It may seem odd to think of stones as musical,\nbut [Ian] Cross [a Cambridge musicologist] points out that so-called lithophones have been\ndocumented in many cultures. Musicologists and anthropologists have recorded or\ndescribed ringing stones and \"rock gongs\" in India, the Americas, Europe, Southeast Asia,\nand Africa.\n    When Cross first began to explore the potential of flint blades as lithophones, he \nconsidered them as percussion instruments like primitive castanets.<sup>3</sup> Touched together, \nthey do make a dull click. It took an archaeologist and a skilled flint-knapper to point out \nthe larger possibilities. Ezra Zubrow of SUNY Buffalo and Frank Cowan of the Cincinnati\nMuseum of Natural History showed Cross that thin, elongated pieces of flint could produce\na tone like a chime. You could say that the idea resonated. ...\n\n- Lois Wingerson\nexcerpted and adapted from \"Rock Music\"\n<i>Archaeology</i>, September/October 2008\n\n<sup>1</sup>crystalline - bell-like; clear\n<sup>2</sup>multidisciplinary - of or representing several fields of study\n<sup>3</sup>castanets - small finger cymbal",

We could see it from the roof of the\ntenement where we lived, the stone towers rising below us from the foreshortened streets\nof downtown Brooklyn. We saw it in newspapers and at the movies and on the covers of\nbooks, part of the signature of the place where we lived. Sometimes, on summer afternoons\nduring World War II, my mother would gather me and my brother Tom and my sister,\nKathleen, and we'd set out on the most glorious of walks.

We walked for miles, leaving\nbehind the green of Prospect Park, passing factories and warehouses and strange \nneighborhoods, crossing a hundred streets and a dozen avenues, seeing the streets turn\ngreen again as we entered Brooklyn Heights, pushing on, beaded with sweat, legs rubbery,\nuntil, amazingly, looming abruptly in front of us, stone and steel and indifferent, was The\nBridge.\n    It was the first man-made thing that I knew was beautiful. We could walk across it, \ngazing up at the great arc of the cables. We could hear the sustained eerie musical note they\nmade when combed by the wind (and augmented since by the hum of automobile tires),\nand we envied the gulls that played at the top of those arches. The arches were Gothic, and\nprovided a sense of awe that was quite religious. And awe infused the view of the great \nharbor, a view my mother embellished by describing to us the ships that had brought her\nand so many other immigrants to America-the Irish and the Italians and the Jews, the\nGermans, the Poles, and the Swedes, all of them crowding the decks, straining to see their\nnewfound land. What they saw first was the Statue of Liberty, and the skyline, and The\nBridge. The Brooklyn Bridge. ...\n    There was a long time in my life when I didn't see much of The Bridge, except from the\nroof or the back window. The reason was simple: Trolleys were replaced by automobiles,\nand nobody I knew in our neighborhood owned a car. But then when I was sixteen, I got a\njob in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a sheet-metal worker, and at lunchtime we would wander\nout along the cobblestone streets beside the dry docks, and from there we could look up at\nThe Bridge. \"Now the cats that built that,\" a black welder named Fred Thompson said to\nme one day, \"they knew what they were <i>doin'</i>.\"\n    They certainly did. As I grew older, I came increasingly to see The Bridge as a \nmonument to craft. It was New York's supreme example of the Well-Made Thing. All\naround us in the sixties, the standards of craft eroded. As aestheticians<sup>1</1> proclaimed the\nvirtues of the spontaneous, or exalted the bold gesture, or condemned form as an artistic\nstraitjacket, I would cross The Bridge and wonder what they could mean. More than \ntwenty men were killed in the construction of this thing, and others were ruined for life by\naccidents and disease suffered in its service. To those men, carelessness meant death, not\nsimply for themselves, but for the human beings who would use what they were making. So\nthey had no choice: They had to make it to last. And in doing so, in caring about detail and\nfunction and strength, they saw craft triumph into art. ... \n    Of course, it is the nature of all bridges that they travel in two directions. I know dozens\nof people who traveled west on The Bridge, wandered the world, and then made the long,\nwide circle home to Brooklyn. I don't know anybody who ever did that from the Bronx.\nFrom the Manhattan shore, The Bridge still seems to whisper: \"Come, travel across me. It's\nonly 1,562 feet across the river, and over here, and beyond, lies Oz, or Camelot, or\nYoknapatawpha County.\"<sup>2</sup> And from the Brooklyn side it speaks in plain, bourgeois<sup>3</sup> tones,\nwith a plain, simple message: \"Come home.\" ...\n\n- Pete Hamill\nexcerpted from \"Bridge of Dreams\"\n<i>New York Magazine</i>, May 30, 1983\n\n<sup>1</sup> aestheticians - specialists in the nature of beauty\n<sup>2</sup> Oz, Camelot, Yoknapatawpha County - fictional places\n<sup>3</sup>bourgeois - middle class",

In addition to being\nsomewhat larger, ravens have a heavier beak with a decided \"Roman nose\" appearance.\nThey also have shaggy throat feathers, called hackles, which can be slicked down or fluffed\nout, apparently to aid communication.

This bird has made a remarkable comeback in the last few decades, \nhowever, partly due to its ability to take advantage of the presence of people.

The raven, you see, is a bit of an aerial acrobat and seems to fly for\nthe sheer joy of it. Rolls, somersaults and even level flight upside-down may be the most\nspectacular behaviors the casual birder will be able to observe.\n    Because both birds are large, black, and similarly shaped, it can be hard to tell the \ncommon raven from the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In addition to being\nsomewhat larger, ravens have a heavier beak with a decided \"Roman nose\" appearance.\nThey also have shaggy throat feathers, called hackles, which can be slicked down or fluffed\nout, apparently to aid communication. In flight, their rounded, wedge-shaped tails and\nfeathers resemble extended fingers near the ends of their wings. ...\n    The raven is both predator and scavenger. Although omnivorous, most of its diet is \nanimal matter, including insects, lizards, frogs, rodents and the eggs and young of other\nbirds. In addition, it regularly dines on carrion<sup>2</sup> and garbage.\n    The raven's sometimes inexplicable and genuinely annoying habits-they've been\nknown to harass livestock and pets, pilfer golf balls and peck holes in the skins of \nunattended light airplanes-led to human reactions that thinned its ranks, particularly in\nthe Northeast. This bird has made a remarkable comeback in the last few decades, \nhowever, partly due to its ability to take advantage of the presence of people. The raven can\nsurvive everything from arctic to desert conditions, often aided, ironically, by garbage\ndumps and other artifacts of human settlement. ...\n    Raven pairs stay together throughout the breeding season and usually bond for life.\nCourtship displays generally begin in February, just before breeding. Pairs often return to\nprevious nesting areas and begin a spectacular aerial courtship ritual. They perform unison\nflight maneuvers, sometimes circling their chosen nest site with wingtips nearly touching.\nOccasionally, the male takes steep, sudden dives or tumbles in mid-air. Feather-preening\nseems to be a common activity while earthbound.\n    Ravens prefer remote, forested areas with tall coniferous trees or rocky ledges where\nthey can build nests and catch air currents that loft them into soaring flights. They also nest\non rugged seacoasts and forested marine islands, as are found off the coast of Maine. ...\n    Nests tend to be built in solitary places, typically miles from other raven nests.\nSometimes, new nests are built atop old ones, although nesting pairs may alternate among\ntwo or more sites in the same nesting area from year to year. In this way, the best nesting\nareas can be used for 100 years or more. ...\n    Many a researcher has discovered firsthand the cunning ways of the raven. Generally\nacknowledged to be among the most intelligent of birds, ravens display a seeming social\nawareness, even with other species, and surprising problem-solving abilities.\n    Accounts abound of ravens closely following large predators such as wolves or coyotes,\nand of sharing, unmolested, in their kills once the carnivores opened the carcasses.\nAlthough this could be seen as just opportunistic feeding, the easy relationship between the\nspecies seems to hint at something more substantial.\n    Inuit<sup>3</sup> hunting traditions advise watching where ravens circle and dip their wings as a\nsure tipoff to the location of game.

It was just an\nold habit he had, left over from wilder times: checking, looking for [a] sign of one kind or\nanother, honing his instincts, as much as anything. In his years as a Ranger captain it had\nbeen his habit to get off by himself for a time, every night, out of camp and away from \nwhatever talking and bickering were going on. He had discovered early on that his instincts\nneeded privacy in which to operate. Sitting around a fire being sociable, yawning and \nyarning, might be fine in safe country, but it could cost you an edge in country that wasn't\nso safe. He liked to get off by himself, a mile or so from camp, and listen to the country, not\nthe men.\n    Of course, real scouting skills were superfluous in a place as tame as Lonesome Dove,\nbut Call still liked to get out at night, sniff the breeze and let the country talk. The country\ntalked quiet; one human voice could drown it out, particularly if it was a voice as loud as\nAugustus McCrae's. Augustus was notorious all over Texas for the strength of his voice. On\na still night he could be heard at least a mile, even if he was more or less \nwhispering. Call did his best to get out of range of Augustus's voice so that he could relax\nand pay attention to other sounds. If nothing else, he might get a clue as to what weather\nwas coming-not that there was much mystery about the weather around Lonesome Dove.\nIf a man looked straight up at the stars he was apt to get dizzy, the night was so clear. Clouds\nwere scarcer than cash money, and cash money was scarce enough.\n    There was really little in the way of a threat to be looked for, either. A coyote might\nsneak in and snatch a chicken, but that was about the worst that was likely to happen. The\nmere fact that he and Augustus were there had long since discouraged the local\nhorsethieves. ...\n    He tried hard to keep sharp, but in fact the only action he had scared up in six months\nof watching the river was one bandit, who might just have been a <i>vaquero</i><sup>1</sup> with a thirsty\nhorse. All Call had had to do in that instance was click the hammer of his Henry-in the\nstill night the click had been as effective as a shot. The man wheeled back into Mexico, and\nsince then nothing had disturbed the crossing except a few mangy goats on their way to the\nsalt lick. ...\n    But somehow, despite the dangers, Call had never felt pressed in quite the way he had\nlately, bound in by the small but constant needs of others. The physical work didn't matter:\nCall was not one to sit on a porch all day, playing cards or gossiping. He intended to work;\nhe had just grown tired of always providing the example. He was still the Captain, but no\none had seemed to notice that there was no troop and no war. He had been in charge so\nlong that everyone assumed all thoughts, questions, needs, and wants had to be referred to\nhim, however simple these might be. The men couldn't stop expecting him to [c]aptain, and\nhe couldn't stop thinking he had to.

Later that year he joined Alexander Graham Bell and three other members\nof the Aerial Experiment Association to help create ailerons, hinged wing flaps that enable \nairplanes to bank and turn. Curtiss went on to make America's first exhibition flight, win the\nfirst international air-speed prize at Reims, France, in 1909, and design the first practical\nseaplane.\n    In World War I he made millions with seaplanes and the Curtiss Jenny, a sturdy, \naffordable trainer that became the workhorse of barnstormers<sup>1</sup> and airmail pilots after the\nwar. In 1917 he created the Curtiss Autoplane, an unsuccessful hybrid of airplane and car.\n    In the 1920s the \"King of the Air\" found that he hankered to get back to his lifelong\nloves of hunting, fishing, and camping. At 40, he wanted more comfort for his road trips, so\nhe decided to build his own travel trailer and create a new business to do so.\n    The timing seemed right. The Roaring Twenties saw Detroit's automobile industry \nrunning full throttle; Americans flocked to the nation's highways. With so few facilities on\nthe road, many long-distance drivers simply brought their own, sometimes by building \ntrailers for themselves. ...\n    Curtiss also designed his Aerocar [travel trailer] to free passengers from the tyranny of\nbad roads. In the words of his patent application, the occupants of normal vehicles \"are \njolted and jostled about in a most objectionable manner; in fact, so much so that riding\nbecomes irksome, tiresome, and uncomfortable in the extreme.\" That was not the case for\nAerocar passengers, who could lounge in fixed armchairs, enjoying close-set windows that\ncreated 10-foot fields of vision on both sides, broken only by window posts. An occupant\ncould also stretch out on the rear-facing divan in the prow, under a built-in Philco radio. \nA table snapped into place so that passengers might play cards or sit down to a meal \ncreated in the galley,<sup>2</sup> with its two-burner gasoline stove, icebox, and sink. The chemical \ntoilet had its own private compartment.\n    A privacy curtain turned the galley into a shower. (A drain in the linoleum took care of\nthe water.) Concealed Pullman-type bunks pulled down from the roof, while armchairs\nfolded down to make additional sleeping spaces. Snap-up privacy curtains and individual\nreading lights added further amenities.\n    The Aerocar's $2,600 price tag clearly placed it in the luxury market, which made it \ndifficult to sell during the Depression. Nevertheless, sales of Aerocars managed to weather\nthe hard times, even surviving Curtiss's unexpected death in 1930 at age 52. ...\n    In the Depression year of 1936, the New York Times estimated that 100,000 trailers of\nall sorts were already on the road, while buyers were prepared to snap up another\n300,000-more than six times what the country's estimated 300 manufacturers expected to\nproduce in a year. \"A new industry is rapidly coming to the front,\" the paper said. \"It is not\nan uncommon sight these days to drive past a factory making trailers and find it operating\nfull blast in the middle of the night. Many plants are running twenty-four hours a day, seven\ndays a week.\" At the National Automobile Show later that year, dealers displayed 50 \ndifferent models, ranging in price from $275 to $12,000. ...\n\n- Kirk W.
