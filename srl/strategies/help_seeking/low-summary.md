The results from the survey indicate that you **do not frequently** seek out assistance from others when needed. Seeking help is a very powerful strategy to use in college because of the many people and resources that are available to support you when things are confusing or difficult. You might benefit from becoming more strategic about getting assistance when you need it. 

Some **help-seeking strategies** that you might want to consider include the following:

1.	Identify and write down the specific things that give you trouble, and ask your advisor for suggestions for getting assistance.
2.	At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best ways to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call).
3.	Advocate for yourself -- be persistent if your first attempt to get help is not successful.
