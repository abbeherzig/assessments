You are someone who **infrequently** seeks out assistance or help from others. Because there are many things that can be confusing or difficult in college, you may need to strongly consider how you can effectively seek out help from teachers or advisors when needed.

Example of strategies that can help you get the assistance you need include: 

1.	Identify and write down the specific things that you give you trouble.
2.	At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call)
3.	Advocate for yourself - be persistent if your first attempt to get help does not get a response.
