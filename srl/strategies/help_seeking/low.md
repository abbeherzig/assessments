## Strategies for Help Seeking

Asking for help when you get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill in college. The reality is that some college classes and topics can be very difficult. Further, when taking online classes, there may not always be a teacher monitoring your progress and checking in with you about your work. A key to success is seeking out and getting assistance to help you learn.

Based on the SRL survey, it appears that you **rarely** reach out for help when needed. This is understandable because seeking out help is not an easy thing to do. Students can feel intimidated or anxious. They also may not now what to say or how to ask. However, learning how to get the assistance and help you need is critical to improving your learning, helping you to complete assignments correctly, and feeling more confident in yourself.  

Read the scenario below to more clearly see why getting the help you need in college is an important thing to do.

> Erica, a 29 year old who works as an elementary school aide, recently enrolled in an online college English course. Erica considers herself to be a smart, hardworking professional and believes she will succeed in the course without much difficulty. During the second lesson, Erica began having trouble comprehending some course material. Instead of asking for clarification, Erica tried to figure out the confusing content on her own. She thought, "I am smart enough to make it this far, I should be able to do this. Plus, talking to teachers makes me nervous!" Erica continued to push her way through each lesson, ignoring content she did not understand. As the course continued, Erica began to feel overwhelmed and frustrated, and she was no longer confident in her ability to do well in the course. Of greatest concern was that because Erica now avoided certain topics, she had difficulty understanding more advanced concepts in class, which caused her to fall further behind in her classwork.

Erica's attitude of "I don't need to ask for help" is fairly common among college students. Some of the frustration and anxiety that she experienced could have been avoided if she was able to effectively seek out help. Just remember that getting the help from others is NOT an admission that you cannot learn well or are dumb. Be an advocate for yourself and seek out the help you need!
