## Strategies for Help Seeking

Some classes and topics in college can be difficult. Further, when taking online classes, there might not always be a teacher monitoring your progress and checking in with you about your work. As a result, asking for help when you get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill. 

According to the SRL assessment results, it appears that you **rarely** reach out for help when needed (see your responses below). This is understandable, since seeking out help is not an easy thing to do. Students can feel intimidated or anxious, or like they just don't have time. They also might not know what to say or how to ask. However, learning how to get the assistance you need is critical to improving your learning, helping you to complete assignments correctly, and feeling more confident about your school work. This scenario illustrates how important it is to get help when you need it:

> Erica, a 29 year old who works as an elementary school aide, recently enrolled in an online college English course. Erica considers herself to be a smart, hardworking professional and believes she will succeed in the course without much difficulty. During the second lesson, Erica began having trouble comprehending some course material. Instead of asking for clarification, Erica tried to figure out the confusing content on her own. She thought, "I am smart enough to have made it this far, I should be able to do this. Plus, talking to teachers makes me nervous!" Erica continued to push her way through each lesson, ignoring content she did not understand. As the course continued, Erica felt overwhelmed and frustrated, and she was no longer confident in her ability to do well in the course. Of greatest concern was that, because Erica had avoided certain topics, she had difficulty understanding more advanced concepts in class, which then caused her to fall further behind in her classwork.

Erica's attitude--"I don't want to ask for help"--is fairly common among college students. But much of the frustration and anxiety that she experienced could have been avoided if she had been mindful of the fact that getting the help from others is not an admission that she could not learn, or was dumb: Help-seeking is a hallmark of successful, self-regulated students.
