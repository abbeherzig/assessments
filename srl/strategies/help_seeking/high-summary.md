You are someone who **frequently** seeks out assistance or help from others. Seeking out help is GREAT strategy to use in college because  of the many things that can be confusing or difficult.

Some additional help-seeking strategies that you may want to consider includes the following:

1.	Identify and write down the specific things that you give you trouble.
2.	At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call)
3.	Advocate for yourself - be persistent if your first attempt to get help does not get a response.
