The results from the survey indicate that you **frequently** seek out assistance or help from others when needed. Seeking out help is a GREAT strategy to use in college because of the many things that are confusing and difficult.

Some additional **help-seeking strategies** that you may want to consider include the following:

1.	Identify and write down the specific things that give you trouble.
2.	At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call).
3.	Advocate for yourself - be persistent if your first attempt to get help does not get a response.
