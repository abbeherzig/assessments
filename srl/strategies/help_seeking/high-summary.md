The results from the survey indicate that you **frequently** seek out assistance from others when needed. Seeking help is a GREAT strategy to use in college because of the many people and resources that are available to support you when things are confusing or difficult.

Some additional **help-seeking strategies** that you may want to consider include the following:

1.	Identify and write down the specific things that give you trouble, and ask your advisor for suggestions for getting assistance.
2.	At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call).
3.	Advocate for yourself--be persistent if your first attempt to get help does not get a response.
