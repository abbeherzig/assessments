## Strategies for Help Seeking

Asking for help when you get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill in college. The reality is that some classes and topics in college can be very difficult. Further, when taking online classes, there may not always be a teacher monitoring your progress and checking in with you about your work. Finally, seeking out help is NOT an admission that you are incompetent or that you cannot learn well.

Based on the SRL survey, it appears that you sometimes reach out for help when needed. You may ask your teacher questions about the details of upcoming assignments or about a topic that confuses you. Doing these things is so important because it can improve your learning, help you to complete assignments correctly, and make you feel more confident about school. 

Read the scenario below to learn more about how not seeking out help in college can adversely impact students in college.

> Erica, a 29 year old who works as an elementary school aide, recently enrolled in an online college English course. Erica considers herself to be a smart, hardworking professional and believes she will succeed in the course without much difficulty. During the second lesson, Erica began having trouble comprehending some course material. Instead of asking for clarification, Erica tried to figure out the confusing content on her own. She thought, "I am smart enough to make it this far, I should be able to do this. Plus, talking to teachers makes me nervous!" Erica continued to push her way through each lesson, ignoring content she did not understand. As the course continued, Erica began to feel overwhelmed and frustrated, and she was no longer confident in her ability to do well in the course. Also, because Erica ignored certain topics, she had difficulty understanding more complex material, which caused her to fall behind on class work.

Erica's attitude of "I don't need to ask for help" is fairly common among college students. As we noted above, seeking out help is not a sign that you are weak or dumb. Much of the frustration and feeling of anxiety that Erica experienced could have been avoided if she learned how to effectively seek out help. Just remember that it is up to you to seek out the assistance that you might need to flourish in school.
Example of strategies that can help you get the assistance you need include: 

1. Identify and write down the specific things that you give you trouble.
2. At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call)
3. Advocate for yourself - be persistent if your first attempt to get help does not get a response.
