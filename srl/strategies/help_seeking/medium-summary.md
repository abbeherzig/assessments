You are someone who **sometimes** seeks out assistance or help from others. Because there are many things that can be confusing or difficult in college, you may benefit from using help-seeking tactics to get the information you need. 

Example of strategies that can help you get the assistance you need include: 

1.	Identify and write down the specific things that you give you trouble.
2.	At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call)
3.	Advocate for yourself - be persistent if your first attempt to get help does not get a response.
