## Strategies for Help Seeking

Asking for help when you get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill in college. The reality is that some classes and topics in college can be very difficult. Further, when taking online classes, there may not always be a teacher monitoring your progress and checking in with you about your work. Finally, seeking out help is NOT an admission that you are incompetent or that you cannot learn well.

Based on the SRL survey, you **frequently** reach out for help when you need it. You may ask your teacher questions about the details of upcoming assignments or raise some points about a topic that confuses you. Doing these things is so important because it can improve your learning, help you to complete assignments correctly, and make you feel more confident about school.
