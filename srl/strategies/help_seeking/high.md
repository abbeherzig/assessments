## Strategies for Help Seeking

Asking for help when you get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill in college. The reality is that some classes and topics in college can be very difficult. Further, when taking online classes, there may not always be a teacher monitoring your progress and checking in with you about your work. Finally, seeking out help is NOT an admission that you are incompetent or that you cannot learn well.

Based on the SRL survey, it is awesome that you **frequently** reach out for help when needed. You may ask your teacher questions about the details of upcoming assignments or about a topic that confuses you. Doing these things is so important because it can improve your learning, help you to complete assignments correctly, and make you feel more confident about school. 
Some specific help seeking tactics include:

1. Identify and write down the specific things that you give you trouble.
2. At the start of a semester, ask your teachers and advisors about the best way to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call)
3. Advocate for yourself - be persistent if your first attempt to get help does not get a response.
