## Strategies for Help Seeking

The reality is that some classes and topics in college can be difficult. Further, when taking online classes, there may not always be a teacher monitoring your progress and checking in with you about your work. As a result, asking for help when you get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill. 

The SRL assessment results indicate that you **frequently** reach out for help when you need it (see your responses below): You do things like ask your teacher questions about the details of upcoming assignments, and bring up topics that confuse you. Although your help-seeking habits seem strong, you can learn more by clicking on any of the **Learn**, **See**, or **Do** buttons below.
