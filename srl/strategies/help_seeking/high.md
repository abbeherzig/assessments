## Strategies for Help Seeking

Asking for help when you get stuck or do not understand something is an important survival skill in college. The reality is that some classes and topics in college can be very difficult. Further, when taking online classes, there may not always be a teacher monitoring your progress and checking in with you about your work. A key to success is seeking out and getting assistance to help you learn.

Based on the SRL survey, you **frequently** reach out for help when you need it. You do things like ask your teacher questions about the details of upcoming assignments or bring up topics that confuse you.
