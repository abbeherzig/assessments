## Strategies for Managing Environments

There are many things that can cause people to become distracted when doing their work. One of the most common things is not having an effective place to do work. Students may attempt to study with a lot of noise or people around them. They also may let technology interfere with their attention, such as the TV, cell phone, or internet. An important key to success in college is developing proficiency in using **strategies to eliminate or reduce distractions**.

The SRL survey showed that you **rarely** use strategies to reduce enviornmental disruptions or distractions when studying or completing other schoolwork. There are many reasons why students may have difficulty eliminating distractions. Regardless of the reason, if you allow others to distract you or if you choose to study in a place with many distractors (i.e. TV on, people talking, access to games/social media), it will be difficult for you to concentrate or focus. Frequently becoming distracted can also lead to turning assignments in late and feeling overwhelmed or stressed out. 

Read the scenario below to learn more about why reducing distractions and disruptions is a key survival skill in college:

> Gloria, a first year college student, was feeling stressed and overwhelmed about a research paper that she had to write within a week. While writing the paper, Gloria had her cell phone on her desk and would continually check out the texts that her friends were sending back and forth. She also would attempt to do her work when her children or other family members were around. At one point, she stated to herself, "I am so stressed out. I just can't seem to concentrate. I have so much to do, but I can't seem to get anything done." Because her life was so hectic and busy, Gloria found it nearly impossible to adequately reflect on the different ways for making the situation better. Gloria thought about how hard college was and whether she should continue. 

A key problem was that Gloria did not know how to take control of the situation. She did not realize that there are many strategies that students can use to minimize distractions and interruptions as they complete their work; strategies that could give her more time to study and concentrate on her work.
