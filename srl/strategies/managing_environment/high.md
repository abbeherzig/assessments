## Strategies for Managing Environments

In addition to using strategies to manage your time, seek out help from others, and learn and remember information, most students need to show proficiency in using **strategies to eliminate or reduce distractions** as they complete their coursework.

The SRL survey showed that you **frequently** use strategies to minimize disruptions and distractions when studying or competing other types of schoolwork. Thus, you often think about different ways to concentrate or to make sure that your family or friends do not distract you from learning.

Keep up the good work!
