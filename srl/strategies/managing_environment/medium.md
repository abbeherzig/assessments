## Strategies for Managing Environments

In addition to using strategies to *manage your time*, *seek out help from others*, and to *learn and remember information*, successful students at the college level often show proficiency in using strategies to **eliminate or reduce distractions** that they receive in school. 

The SRL survey showed that you **occasionally** use strategies to reduce disruptions or distractions when completing your schoolwork. Thus, you may not do these things as often as you could. If you allow others to distract you or if you choose to study in a place with many distractions (i.e. TV on, people talking, access to games/social media), it will be difficult for you to concentrate or focus at times. Getting distracted during your work can also cause you to turn in assignment late or to feel that you do not have enough time to complete your work. 

Read the scenario below to learn more about why reducing distractions when completing your schoolwork is of critical importance:

> Gloria, a first year college student, was feeling stressed and overwhelmed about a research paper that she had to write within a week. While writing the paper, Gloria had her cell phone on her desk and would continually get check out the texts that her friends were sending back and forth. She also would attempt to do her work when her children or other family members were around. At one point, she stated to herself, "I am so stressed out. I just can't seem to concentrate. I have so much to do, but I can't seem to get anything done." Because her life was so hectic and busy, Gloria did not have time to reflect on ways of making the situation better. Gloria thought about how hard college was and whether she should continue. 

Unfortunately, Gloria did not know how to take control of the situation. She did not realize that she could learn strategies to minimize distractions and interruptions as she completed her work; things that could give her more time to study and to more fully concentrate on her work.

To improve your skills in creating an effective and comfortable place to do your schoolwork:

1.	Set rules for others in your house about "do not disturb" times
2.	Turn off your cell phone and other technology
3.	Identify 2-3 comfortable and quiet places to study so that you have options
