## Strategies for Managing Environments

In addition to using strategies to *manage your time, seek out help from others*, and to *learn and remember information*, successful students at the college level often show proficiency in using strategies to **eliminate or reduce distractions** that they receive in school. 

The SRL survey showed that you **frequently** use strategies to minimize disruptions and distractions as you complete your schoolwork. Thus, you often think about different ways to help you concentrate and to get into the flow of learning. May students will struggle in school because they allow themselves to become distracted by TV, their cell phone, friends, etc. It is awesome that you donâ€™t often let this happen to you. Keep up the good work! 

To continue creating an optimal place to do your schoolwork:

1.	Set rules for others in your house about "do not disturb" times
2.	Turn off your cell phone and other technology
3.	Identify 2-3 comfortable and quiet places to study so that you have options
