## Strategies for Managing Time

Going to college requires students to use effective time management strategies in order to manage multiple tasks and avoid becoming overwhelmed. People who use time management strategies tend to work more efficiently, feel less stressed, and experience a greater level of confidence in school. Fortunately, your SRL assessment results suggest that you **frequently** use strategies to manage your time (see your responses below). You probably do things like set aside regular times for schoolwork, use a calendar to mark down due dates for assignments, and keep track of much time assignments take. Good for you!
