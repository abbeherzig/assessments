## Strategies for Managing Time

**Time management** is a key to student success in college. A lot of demands and expectations are placed on students. Thus, we know that you all are very busy people! To keep things manageable and to prevent yourself from becoming overwhelmed, it is important that you use effective time management strategies. 

The SRL survey showed that you **sometimes** use strategies to manage your time. It is good that you occasionally use some of these strategies, like setting aside regular times for schoolwork, using calendars to mark down due dates for assignments, or keeping track of how long assignments take to complete.

Read the scenario below to see how insufficient time management tactics can adversely impact students in college.

> Sam, a second year college student, performs well in some classes but not in others. He tends to struggle most in classes that involve very unfamiliar information or when there are a lot of different assignments to complete. This semester, Sam was required to enroll in a college math course, which covered material that was new to Sam. With the first exam of the semester approaching in about one week, Sam reminded himself that he needed to study to learn this new material. Sam sat down to study, but soon thereafter received a text from his friends inviting him to play basketball. Since the exam was a week away, Sam figured that he could play basketball that night and could study later; after all, it was important for Sam to stay in touch with friends and get exercise too. As the week progressed, Sam got involved with assignments for other classes and more basketball games, and forgot that he needed to study for the math exam until the night or two before the test. Sam decided to study each chapter that he would be tested on, and began to read the first chapter. The night before the test, Sam realized he had only finished 1 of 4 chapters and that the only way he could cover all the material was if he stayed up all night. Sam felt anxious and stressed, barely slept, and still felt as if he was unprepared for the exam.

Sam did not realize that he could have avoided the feelings of dread and the chaotic night before the test if he spaced out his studying and set specific days and times to devote to his studies. He could have also used a calendar as a daily reminder about when and what to study.
