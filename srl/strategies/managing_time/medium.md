## Strategies for Managing Time

Going to college requires students to use effective time management strategies in order to manage multiple tasks and avoid becoming overwhelmed. People who use time management strategies tend to work more efficiently, feel less stressed, and experience a greater level of confidence in school. Your SRL survey results suggest that you **sometimes** use strategies to manage your time (see your responses below). You might do things like set aside regular times for schoolwork, use a calendar to mark down due dates for assignments, or keep track of much time assignments take--but not as often as you could.  

This scenario illustrates how insufficient time management tactics can adversely impact students in college:

> Sam, a second year college student, performs well in some classes but not in others. He tends to struggle most in classes that involve very unfamiliar information or when there are a lot of different assignments to complete. This semester, Sam was required to enroll in a college math course that covered material that was new to him. With the first exam of the semester approaching in one week, Sam reminded himself that he needed to study this new material. He sat down to study, but soon received a text from his friends inviting him to play basketball. Since the exam was a week away, Sam figured that he could play basketball that night and could study later; after all, it was important to stay in touch with friends and get exercise, too. As the week progressed, Sam got involved with assignments for other classes and more basketball games, and neglected to study for the math exam until two nights before the test. He decided to study each chapter that would be tested, and began to read the first one. The night before the test, Sam realized he had  finished only one of the four chapters, and the only way he could cover all the material was if he stayed up all night. Sam barely slept. By morning he felt anxious,  stressed, and still unprepared for the exam. He was so tired during the test that he could hardly think. 

Sam realized he should have spaced out his studying over the course of the week, and set specific days and times to devote to his studies. He also knew he should use the calendar on his phone to set up daily reminders about when and what to study.
