## Strategies for Managing Time

Time management is a key to student success in college. A lot of demands and expectations are placed on students. To keep things manageable and to avoid becoming overwhelmed, it is important that you use effective time management strategies.  

The SRL survey showed that you **sometimes** use strategies to manage your time. It is good that you occasionally use some of these strategies, like setting aside regular times for schoolwork, using calendars to mark down due dates for assignments, or keeping track of how long assignments take to complete.

More effectively managing your time will help you work more efficiently, feel less stressed, and become more confident in school. All of these things help to increase student success.

Read the scenario below to get a better feel for how inconsistent use of time management strategies may adversely impact students in college.

> Sam, a second year college student, performed well in some classes but not others. He tends to struggle most in classes that involved very unfamiliar information or when there was a lot of different assignments to complete. This semester, Sam was required to enroll in a college math course, which covered material that was new to Sam. With the first exam of the semester approaching in about one week, Sam reminded himself that he needed to study to learn this new material. Sam sat down to study when he received a text from his friends inviting him to play basketball. Since the exam was a week away, Sam figured that he could play basketball that night and could study later; after all, it was important for Sam to stay in touch with friends and get exercise too. As the week progressed, Sam got involved with assignments for other classes and more basketball games, and forgot that he needed to study for the math exam until the night before the test. Sam decided to study each chapter that he would be tested on, and began to read the first chapter. Two hours later, Sam realized he had only finished 1 of 4 chapters and that the only way he could cover all the material was if he stayed up all night. Sam felt anxious and stressed, barely slept, and still felt as if he was unprepared for the exam.

What Sam did not realize is that he could have avoided feeling overwhelmed and unprepared if he had set aside times to study throughout the week and used a daily calendar to remind him of when and what to study.   

Here are a few strategies that you can use to improve your time management:

1.	Set aside regular times to study *multiple days* in advanced of a due date.
2.	Prioritize tasks based on the most important things you need to study, such as studying the most difficult things first. 
3.	Use a calendar to remind yourself of upcoming assignments and understand how other activities could conflict with your time to study.
