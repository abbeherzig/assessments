Strategies refer to the procedures or approaches that people use to enhance their learning, knowledge or performance on some activity. The SRL survey examined the frequency with which you reported using four different types of strategies: (a) help-seeking, (b) managing your time, (c) managing your environment, and (d) learning and understanding new material. Given that your overall score indicates that you may **occasionally use these strategies**, there is room for you to improve and learn new strategies.
