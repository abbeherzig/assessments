Strategies refer to the procedures or approaches that people use to enhance their learning, knowledge or performance on some activity. The SRL survey examined the frequency with which you reported using four different types of strategies: (a) help-seeking, (b) managing your time, (c) managing your environment, and (d) learning and understanding new material. Your overall score for **Strategy Use** indicates that you are a **moderate user of strategies**, which means you use some but perhaps not all of the strategic tools needed to perform well in school.
