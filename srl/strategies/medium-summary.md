**Strategies** refer to the procedures or approaches that people use to enhance their learning, knowledge or performance on some activity. The SRL survey examined the frequency with which you reported using four different types of strategies: (a) help-seeking, (b) managing your time, (c) managing your environment, and (d) learning and understanding new material. 

Your overall score indicates that you **occasionally** use these strategies. Thus, there may be some room for you to improve and learn new strategies. Please click on the **More Info** button for more information.
