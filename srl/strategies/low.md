## Strategies

**Strategies** are the procedures we use to learn, remember, and perform well in school. Many students in college need to use different types of strategies to help them succeed. On the SRL survey, we assessed how freuqenlty you use four types of strategies: (1) **seeking help from others**, **(2) managing and organizing your time**, **eliminating distractions in your enviornment**, and **learning and remembering new information**. 

Your overall score for **Strategy Use** indicates that you **do not frequently use these strategies**. Perhaps you never needed to learn about these procedures or perhaps you prefer to use other types of strategies. Because the four strategies that wee assessed are often very helpful to college studets, we encourage you to read the brief explanation below for each of them.
