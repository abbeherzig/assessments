## Strategies

Students tend to develop a toolbox of strategies for learning as they progress through college. The purpose of the feedback in this section is to help you fill up that toolbox.

Either way, we believe that you would benefit from doing two things: (1) Read the brief explanations of each of the four strategies below, and (2) click on the **More Info** buttons for the strategies that you would like to learn more about.
