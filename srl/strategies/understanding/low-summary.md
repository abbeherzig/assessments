Because you are expected to process a lot of information in college, it is important that you are able to effectively organize, synthesize, and recall course-related information. Your assessment results show that you **do not frequently** use strategies to remember and understand course content. You might use one or two techniques like reviewing information until it is mastered, paying attention to the most important information, asking questions, or putting new ideas into your own words, but there are many more powerful strategies available to you.  

To add to your toolbox of **learning strategies**, consider trying these:

1.	Study course material over several short study sessions rather than one long session.
2.	Use practice quizzes or tests to check your understanding of course material. Restudy only the material you got wrong.
3.	Elaborate on information by using concept maps or making summaries.
