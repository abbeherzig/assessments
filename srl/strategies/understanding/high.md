## Strategies for Managing Understanding & Learning

One of the most challenging things students have to do is **learn and remember information** presented in their courses. Students who perform well in college tend to use a variety of different strategies to do this very thing.

The SRL survey showed that you **frequently** use different types of strategies to help you learn and remember information (see your responses below). You might do different things like reread your study materials, use diagrams or concept maps to summarize information, or focus much of your attention to the most important pieces of information. Having a strong repertoire of study strategies is important because it will not only increase your learning and retention of information, it will give you different options just in case you get stuck.
