Your survey results show that you **frequently** use strategies to remember and understand information. You probably use techniques like reviewing information until it is mastered, paying attention to the most important information, asking questions, and putting new ideas into your own words.  

To add to your toolbox of **learning strategies**, consider trying these:

1.	Study course material over several short study sessions rather than one long session.
2.	Use practice quizzes or tests to check your understanding of course material. Restudy only the material you got wrong.
3.	Elaborate on information by using concept maps or making summaries.
