## Strategies for Managing Understanding & Learning

In addition to using strategies to seek help from others, manage your time, and limit distractions, successful students at the college level often show an ability in being able to use strategies to learn and remember different kinds of information.

The SRL survey showed that you rarely use strategies to help you learn and remember information. It seems likely that you often feel â€˜stuck' when studying and that you may have difficulty remembering things for tests. The most important thing to realize is that all college students have the potential to learn new ways or strategies on how to study and remember information. 
Read the scenario below to develop a better understanding of the importance of using different strategies to help you learn, understand, and remember information.

> Steven, a second year college student, was feeling overwhelmed and defeated while studying for his math test. Steven's primary approach to studying was reading over the chapters and to briefly reviewing his class his notes. On many occasions during studying, he became confused and did not understand what he was reading. Instead of going back and trying to understand the section, or using a different source to learn the information, he simply avoided what he did not understand. Steven thought to himself, "I don't get this stuff, but I don't know what else I can do!" When he talked to one of his classmates, Elizabeth, about his struggles, she opened up his eyes to a whole new way of studying. Elizabeth stated, "When it comes to math class, I have learned that I need to do a lot of practice problems. Reading my notes never really helped me. I also repeatedly take practice tests so that I know which problems I have to study and which ones I have mastered." Steven asked Elizabeth where she learned some of these strategies. She told him that she figured out some on her own but got a few extra ideas from the DAACS feedback.

Like most students, Steven studied for tests in a fairly narrow way. He tended to using the same study approach regardless of the class. But his approach was often ineffective. One of the most important things that college students need to do is to learn a wide array of study strategies when learning in different classes so that they can so they have options to chose from when needed.
Some study tactics to improve your learning include the following:

1.	Have several short study sessions rather than one long study session
2.	Use practice quizzes or tests to check your understand 
3.	Elaborate on information by using concept maps or making summaries
