## Strategies for Managing Understanding & Learning

Students who perform well in college use a variety of learning strategies to **understand** new material. A diverse collection of study strategies is valuable because different subjects require different approaches to learning: One course might lend itself to writing summaries of key points from a lesson in your own words, while in another it may be more useful to create concept maps to organize information. The SRL survey showed that you **occasionally** use different types of strategies to help you learn and remember information (see your responses below). You might not consistently use the most effective strategies, or perhaps, like many people, you have a limited repertoire. 

This scenario illustrates how using different strategies can help you more easily understand and remember information:

> Steven, a second year college student, was feeling overwhelmed and defeated while studying for his math test. Steven's primary approach to studying was reading over the chapters and briefly reviewing his class notes. On many occasions, he became confused and did not understand what he was reading. Instead of going back and trying to understand the section, or using a different source to learn the information, he simply avoided what he did not understand. He thought to himself, "I don't get this stuff, but I don't know what else I can do!" When he talked to one of his classmates, Elizabeth, about his struggles, she opened up his eyes to a whole new way of studying. Elizabeth told him, "When it comes to math, I need to do a lot of practice problems and see where I have trouble. Reading my notes is only helpful when I'm trying to figure out a problem I don't understand. Taking the practice tests tells me which problems I have to study and which ones I have mastered." Steven asked Elizabeth where she learned this strategy. She told him that her high school teacher told her to do practice problems but she never understood their value until she read the SRL feedback.

Like many students, Steven studied for tests in a fairly narrow way. He tended to use the same study approach regardless of the class. His approach was often ineffective, but he didn't know what else to do.
