## Strategies for Managing Understanding & Learning

One of the most challenging things students have to do is **learn and remember information** presented in their courses. Students who perform well in college tend to use a vareity of different strategies to do this very thing. 

Your responese to the SRL survey showed that you **occasionally** use strategies to help you learn and remember information. You might do different things like rereading your study materials, using diagrams or concept maps to summarize information, or focusing much of your attention on the most important things to study. However, you may not consistently use these strategies or you may have a limited repertoire. Thus, it appears that you will benefit from learning additional strategies for studying and learning information.

Read the scenario below to to see how using different strategies can help you more easily understand and remember information.

> Steven, a second year college student, was feeling overwhelmed and defeated while studying for his math test. Steven's primary approach to studying was reading over the chapters and briefly reviewing his class notes. On many occasions during studying, he became confused and did not understand what he was reading. Instead of going back and trying to understand the section, or using a different source to learn the information, he simply avoided what he did not understand. Steven thought to himself, "I don't get this stuff, but I don't know what else I can do!" When he talked to one of his classmates, Elizabeth, about his struggles, she opened up his eyes to a whole new way of studying. Elizabeth stated, "When it comes to math, I just need to do a lot of practice problems. Reading my notes never really helped me. I also take a lot of practice tests so that I know which problems I have to study and which ones I have mastered." Steven asked Elizabeth where she learned some of these strategies. She told him that she figured out some on her own but got a few extra ideas from the SRL feedback.

Like most students, Steven studied for tests in a fairly narrow way. He tended to use the same study approach regardless of the class. This approach was often ineffective. A key thing for all college students to recognize is that developing a strong repertoire of study strategies will increase the chances that they have the necessary tools to learn well in all of the their classes.
