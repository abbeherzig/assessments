You are someone who **sometimes** uses strategies to manage your time. Getting better at managing your time is important because it can help you stay organized and prepared.

To improve your time management, consider using the following strategies:

1.	Set aside regular times to study *multiple days* in advanced of a due date.
2.	Prioritize tasks based on the most important things you need to study, such as studying the most difficult things first. 
3. Use a calendar to remind yourself of upcoming assignments and understand how other activities could conflict with your time to study.
