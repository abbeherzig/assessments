Welcome to the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) assessment! The purposes of this assessment are to:

* generate a profile of your SRL skills - motivation beliefs, strategic behaviors, and metacognitive skills 
* give you feedback about your SRL skills and suggestions for improving them, as needed;
* direct you to online resources and strategies to further enhance your ability to manage the demands of college life.

You will be asked to respond to a series of statements about your SRL skills. For some items, you will indicate your level of agreement, whereas for others you will rate how frequently you display certain behaviors. After this SRL assessment, you will have the opportunity to review your SRL skills and the recommended strategies for improving them, as needed.
