Thank you for completing the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of Colleges (DAACS). The results presented here are meant to be informative and instructional; **there is no passing or failing**. Because your results can change due to life circumstances or courses you take, you are encouraged to take SRL survey again, especially when beginning new courses.

Your responses to the SRL items suggest that there are several strategies that you can develop in order to become a successful learner and college student. We recommend visiting each of the domains listed on the left to learn about what it means to be a more self-regulated learner, as well as to access resources and suggestions to enhance your skills.
