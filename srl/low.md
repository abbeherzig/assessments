Thank you for completing the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS). The results presented here are meant to be informative and instructional; **there is no passing or failing**. Because your results can change due to life circumstances or courses you take, you are encouraged to take the SRL survey again, especially when beginning new courses.

Your responses to the SRL items suggest several strategies to focus on in order to become a successful learner and college student. We recommend visiting each of the domains listed on the left to learn about becoming a more self-regulated learner and access resources to enhance your skills.
