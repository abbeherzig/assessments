Thank you for completing the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of Colleges (DAACS). The results presented here are meant to be informative and instructional; **there is no passing or failing**. These results may change based upon the course(s) you are taking, environmental factors, or life circumstances. As such, you are encourage to take DAACS at different times and when beginning new courses.

Your responses to the SRL items suggest you are a *developing learner* which means there are several areas that might be worth exploring to learn new strategies for becoming a successful learner and college student. We suggest visiting each of the domains listed on the left to learn about what it means to be a self-regulated learner, as well as resources and suggestions to enhance those skills.
