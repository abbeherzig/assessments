Thank you for completing the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS). The results presented here are meant to be informative and instructional; **there is no passing or failing**. Because your results can change due to life circumstances or courses you take, you are encouraged to take the SRL survey again, especially when beginning new courses.
