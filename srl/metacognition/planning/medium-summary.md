You are someone who **sometimes** plans how to approach your schoolwork. When you are assigned an activity, you will occasionally think about the most important parts of the activity or how to best approach that activity.

To improve how often you plan or think ahead:

1. Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity:
	a.	What am I expected do?
	b.	What strategy can help me do well? 
2. Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
