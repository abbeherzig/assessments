Your responses to the SRL survey indicate that you **sometimes plan** how to approach your schoolwork. When you are assigned a task, you might occasionally think about the most important parts of the task or how to best approach it.

To improve how you plan or think ahead:

1. Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity: "What am I expected do?	What approach can help me do well?" 
2. Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
