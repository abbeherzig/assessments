Your responses to the SRL survey indicate that you **sometimes plan** how to approach your schoolwork. Thus, before completing an assignment you might think about the most important parts of the assignment or the best approach needed to complete it. Because planning can help students focus their attention and to become more proficient in what they do, you may want to consider using the following planning strategies:

1. Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity: "What am I expected do?	What approach can help me do well?" 
2. Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
3. Ask your teachers about the best ways to go about doing their assignments.
