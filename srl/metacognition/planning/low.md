## Planning

Planning is one aspect of a term we call metacognition -- your level awareness and control over your thinking. Two other areas of metacognition are monitoring and evaluation. The SRL survey examined all three of these areas.

The SRL survey showed that you **rarely plan** how to complete your schoolwork. This means that you probably do not think a lot about the requirement of assignments, which can make it difficult to figure out how to best complete your work. Students who do not frequently plan their schoolwork often need to learn more about planning strategies.

Increasing the frequency with which you plan is important because it can help you complete assignments correctly, on time, and with greater efficiency but less stress. Read the scenario below to see how using planning strategies on a more frequent basis can help to improve your performance in school.

> Sophia, a second year college student, was feeling stressed and overwhelmed as her math course entered its second week. "Wow! I have a lot of assignments for this class," she thought, "I really have to figure out a good plan so that I don't fall behind." After meeting with her advisor, Sophia realized the importance of trying to figure out the requirements for each assignment. Without understanding what is expected, it is virtually impossible to be strategic about completing her assignments. Sophia commented to herself, "Now I need to develop a plan about how to best approach all of my assignment. Because some of them are really unique, I am really going to have to think more about this. I will probably also need to ask my teachers for assistance."

To improve how often you plan or think ahead:

1.	Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity:
	a.	What am I expected do?
	b.	What strategy can help me do well? 
2.	Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
3. Ask teachers and friends questions for assistance.
