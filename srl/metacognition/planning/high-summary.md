Your responses to the SRL survey suggest that you **frequently** plan how to approach your schoolwork. When you are assigned a task, you probably think about the most important parts of the task as well as the best approaches to perform well, which is great.

To continue being a **frequent planner**, consider using the following strategies:

1.	Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity:
	a.	What am I expected do?
	b.	What approach to this work can help me do well? 
2.	Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
3.	Ask your teachers questions about tasks and new material.
