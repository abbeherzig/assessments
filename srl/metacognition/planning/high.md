## Planning

Planning is one aspect of metacognition. Your responses to the SRL survey showed that you are a **frequent** planner. This is a very positive quality because it means that you often think before taking action. When students think about the expectations for assignments, reflect on how to organize their work, and ask themsevles about the best ways to learn, they will often have an easier time completing activities. Keep up the good work!
