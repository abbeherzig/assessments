## Planning

Planning is one aspect of a term we call metacognition -- your level awareness and control over your thinking. Two other areas of metacognition are monitoring and evaluation. The SRL survey examined all three of these areas.

The SRL survey showed that you are a **frequent** planner when completing assignments. This is a very positive quality because it means that you often think before taking action. You will often think a lot about the expectations and requirements of all your assignments. You also use strategies to organize yourself and are very likely to ask yourself questions about how should accomplish a task. 

Being aware of your thinking before starting a task is important because it makes completing these activities easier and increases your confidence to handle different challenges in school. 

Keep up the good work! 

To continue being a **frequent planner**, consider using the following strategies:

1. Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity:
	a.	What am I expected do?
	b.	What strategy can help me do well? 
2. Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
3. Ask teachers and friends questions for assistance.
