## Planning

Planning is one aspect of metacognition. Your responses to the SRL survey showed that you are a **frequent** planner. This is a very positive quality because it means that you often think before taking action. You probably think about the expectations for and requirements of your assignments, organize your work, and ask yourself how best to accomplish a task. 

Being aware of your thinking before starting a task is important because it makes completing activities easier and increases your confidence in handling different challenges in school. Keep up the good work!
