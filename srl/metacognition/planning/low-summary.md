You are someone who **does not frequently** plan how to approach your schoolwork. When you are assigned an activity, you do not typically to think about the most important parts of the activity. You also struggle to identify the most effective approaches to complete that activity.  

To improve how often you plan or think ahead:

1. Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity:
	a.	What am I expected do?
	b.	What strategy can help me do well? 
2. Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
3. Ask teachers and friends questions for assistance.
