Your responses to the SRL survey suggest that you **do not frequently** plan how to approach your schoolwork. When you are assigned a task, you might not think about the most important parts or may not try to identify the most effective approaches to use to complete the task. Planning is such an important part of learning because it helps you to focus your attention and to become more proficient in what you do. To become a more **effective planner**, consider using some of the following strategies:

1.	Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity: "What am I expected do? What approach to this work can help me do well?" 
2.	Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option.
3.	Ask your teachers questions about tasks and new material.
