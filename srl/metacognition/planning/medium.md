## Planning

Planning is one aspect of metacognition. Your responses to the SRL survey suggest that you **sometimes plan** how to complete your schoolwork. This means that you might not always think about the requirements of an assignment, which may lead to mistakes or delays in completing your work. Increasing the frequency with which you plan can help you complete assignments correctly and with greater efficiency but less stress. 

The following scenario illustrates the importance of seeking out help to learn how to plan and prepare in school:

> Sophia, a second year college student, was feeling stressed and overwhelmed as her math course entered its second week. "Wow! I have a lot of assignments for this class," she thought, "I really have to figure out a good plan so that I don't fall behind." After meeting with her DAACS advisor, Sophia realized the importance of trying to figure out the requirements for each assignment, stating, "If I do understand what is expected for an assignment, how on earth can I be strategic about completing it?" Sophia's next step was to develop a plan about how to best approach her work for all of her courses. When speaking with her advisor, Sophia commented, "Because assignments are so different across my classes, I am going to need help in figuring out how my approch might need to differ for each."

Sophia's initial conversation with her advisor changed her outlook and perspective about school. He helped her realize that there was value in pausing and reflecting about an assignment for a few minutes before attempting to complete it. Having this realization naturally led her to seek out assistance about how to become a more effective planner.
