## Planning

Planning is one aspect of metacognition. Your responses to the SRL survey suggest that you **sometimes plan** how to complete your schoolwork. This means that you might not always think about the requirements of an assignment, which can make it difficult to recognize how you should go about completing your work. Increasing the frequency with which you plan can help you complete assignments correctly, on time, and with greater efficiency and less stress. This scenario shows how using planning strategies on a frequent basis can improve performance in school:

> Sophia, a second year college student, was feeling stressed and overwhelmed as her math course entered its second week. "Wow! I have a lot of assignments for this class," she thought, "I really have to figure out a good plan so that I don't fall behind." After meeting with her advisor, Sophia realized the importance of trying to figure out the requirements for each assignment: Without understanding what is expected, it is virtually impossible to be strategic about completing assignments. Sophia commented, "Now I need to develop a plan about how to best approach all of my assignments. Because some of them are unique, I am really going to have to think more about this. I will probably also need to ask my teacher for guidance."
