## Evaluation

Evaluation is one aspect of metacognition. The SRL survey suggests that you **do not frequently** evaluate your learning. It seems that you do not typically try to figure out how well you learned, which strategies helped you learn best, or different things you can do to improve. Being a good self-evaluator can help you avoid mistakes and indicate when you might need to adjust or change. The scenario below illustrates how infrequent metacognitive evaluation can impact your learning.

Anthony, a first-year college student, was preparing for his first history exam of the semester. He studied for a few hours, memorizing key events and dates. He went to the exam confident in his ability to perform well. Much to his surprise, he received a C on the exam. While going over the test in class, Anthony realized that the professor expected him to be able to analyze historical events, not just memorize them. This misunderstanding as well as Anthony's tend to not self-assess or check his learning while studying led him to study in a way that would not lead to success. Anthony felt stuck and somewhat nervous because he is having another exam in a few weeks and doesn't know how to go about studying.

Anthony's experience of overestimating his learning during studying is common among college students. The key to becoming are more effective self-evaluator is to use strategies that help you pause and reflect as you learn.
