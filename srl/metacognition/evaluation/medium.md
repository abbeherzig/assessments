## Evaluation

Evaluation is one aspect of metacognition. The SRL survey results suggest that you are a **partial** evaluator of your learning, meaning that at times you will figure out how well you learned, what worked well, and how you can improve -- but you do not do these things consistently. Being a consistent self-evaluator can help you avoid  mistakes and let you know when you need to adjust or change. The scenario below illustrates how inconsistent evaluation of performance can negatively impact learning.

> Anthony, a first-year college student, was preparing his first History exam of the semester. He studied for several hours and felt very confident about his ability to perform well on the exam. Much to his surprise, he received a C on the exam. While looking over the exam, Anthony thought to himself, "I thought I was learning a lot when I was studying?" Unfortunately, Anthony has a set way of studying and does not typically think about easier or better ways to study for different exams Anthony feels stuck and somewhat nervous now because he doesn't know the best way to study and he is having another exam in a few weeks.

To improve the frequency with which you self-evaluate, consider using the following strategies:

1.	As you work on assignment, ask yourself "Do I seem to be learning what I am supposed to?"
2.	After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" or "What can I do better next time?"
3.	Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you and discard those that don't work.
