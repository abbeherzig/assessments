## Evaluation

Evaluation is one aspect of metacognition. The SRL survey results suggest that you are a **partial** evaluator of your learning, meaning that at times you will figure out how well you learned, what worked well, and how you can improve, but you do not do these things consistently. Being a consistent self-evaluator can help you avoid  mistakes and let you know when you need to adjust or change. This scenario illustrates how inconsistent evaluation of performance can negatively impact learning:

> Anthony, a first-year college student, was preparing for the first history exam of the semester. He studied for a few hours, memorizing key events and dates. He went to the exam confident in his ability to perform well. Much to his surprise, he received a C on the exam. While going over the test in class, Anthony realized that the professor expected him to be able to analyze historical events, not just memorize them. He had used the wrong study strategy, and had not thought about the best way to study for this exam. Anthony felt stuck and somewhat nervous because he doesn't know the best way to study and he is having another exam in a few weeks.
