## Evaluation

Evaluation is one aspect of metacognition. Your responses to the SRL survey suggest that **occasionally evaluate** your learning, meaning that at times you will figure out how well you learned, what worked well, and how you can improve, but you do not do these things consistently. Being a consistent self-evaluator can help you avoid  mistakes and let you know when you need to adjust or change. This scenario illustrates how inconsistent evaluation of performance can negatively impact learning:

Anthony, a first-year college student, was preparing for his first history exam of the semester. He studied for a few hours, memorizing key events and dates. He went to the exam confident in his ability to perform well. Much to his surprise, he received a C on the exam. While going over the test in class, Anthony realized that the professor expected him to be able to analyze historical events, not just memorize them. This misunderstanding as well as Anthony's tend to not self-assess or check his learning while studying led him to study in a way that would not lead to success. Anthony felt stuck and somewhat nervous because he is having another exam in a few weeks and doesn't know how to go about studying.

Anthony's experience of overestimating his learning during studying is common among college students. The key to becoming are more effective self-evaluator is to use strategies that help you pause and reflect as you learn.
