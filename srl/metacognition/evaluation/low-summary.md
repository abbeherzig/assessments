Your score indicates that you **do not frequently** reflect on and evaluate your thinking, learning, and schoolwork. After you complete an assignment, you might not think about how well you performed or how you can improve your learning. Because self-evaluation is a key skill for college students, consider using the following strategies to **enhance your evaluation skills**:

1.	As you work on an assignment, ask yourself "Do I seem to be learning what I am supposed to?"
2.	After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" and "What can I do better next time?"
3.  Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you.
