You are someone who **infrequently** evaluates the ways in which you complete your schoolwork. Thus, while working on a learning activity or after completing it, you have a tendency to not think about or reflect on how well you performed.

To **improve the frequency** with which you self-evaluate, consider using the following strategies:

1.	As you work on assignment, ask yourself "Do I seem to be learning what I am supposed to?"
2.	After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" or "What can I do better next time?"

Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you and discard those that don't work.
