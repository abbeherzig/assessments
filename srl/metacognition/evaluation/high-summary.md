Your score indicates that you **frequently** reflect on and evaluate the ways in which you learn, study, and complete your schoolwork. Because self-evaluation is a key skill for college students, you are right on track with this skill. 

To continue being a **frequent evaluator**, consider using the following strategies:

1.	As you work on assignment, ask yourself "Am I learning what I am supposed to?"
2.	After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" and "What can I do better next time?"
3.	Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you.
