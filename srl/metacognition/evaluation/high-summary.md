You are someone who **frequently** evaluates the ways in which you complete your schoolwork. Thus, while working on a learning activity or after completing it, you are a student who is very likely to reflect on how well you performed. 

To continue being a **frequent evaluator**, consider using the following strategies:

1.	As you work on assignment, ask yourself "Do I seem to be learning what I am supposed to?"
2.	After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" or "What can I do better next time?"
3.	Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you and discard those that don't work.
