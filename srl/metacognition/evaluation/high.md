## Evaluation

Evaluation is one aspect of metacognition. Your SRL assessment results suggest that you **frequently** evaluate your learning. Thus, you seem to figure out how well you learn. You also tend to think about what worked well and how you can improve. Continuing to evaluate your thinking and learning will help you avoid mistakes and can let you know when you might need to adjust your approach to learning and studying.
