## Evaluation

Evaluation is one aspect of a term we call metacognition -- your level awareness and control over your thinking. Two other areas of metacognition are planning and monitoring. The SRL survey examined all three of these areas.

The SRL survey showed that you are a **frequent** evaluator of your learning. You seem to have strong interest in figuring out how well you learn. You also tend to think about what worked well and perhaps how you can improve. Making sure that you remain a frequent evaluator will help you avoid repeating mistakes and can let you know when you might need to adjust or change.

Keep up the good work!

To continue being a **frequent evaluator**, consider using the following strategies:

1.	As you work on assignment, ask yourself "Do I seem to be learning what I am supposed to?"
2.	After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" or "What can I do better next time?"
3.	Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you and discard those that don't work.
