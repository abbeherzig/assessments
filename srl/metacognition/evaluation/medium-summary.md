Your score indicates that you **sometimes** reflect on and evaluate the ways in which you learn, study, and complete your schoolwork. Thus, after you complete an assignment, you might not always think about how well you performed or how you can improve your learning.To **increase the frequency** with which you self-evaluate, consider using the following strategies:

1.	As you work on an assignment, ask yourself "Do I seem to be learning what I am supposed to?"
2.	After you complete an assignment, ask yourself, "What was the most important thing I learned?" and "What can I do better next time?"
3.	Keep a list of learning strategies that seem to work best for you.
