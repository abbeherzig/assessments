Metacognition reflects how we think about our thinking. It involves how aware you are of your thinking and your skill in controlling how you think about your approach to learning. The SRL survey examined three critical aspects of metacognition â€“ the extent to which you plan before you learn, how frequently you monitor or keep track of your learning, and the extent to which you reflect on and evaluate how you learn. Your score suggests there are some areas in need of improvement.
