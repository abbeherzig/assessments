Metacognition is thinking about your thinking. It involves being aware of your thoughts and controlling how you approach learning. The SRL survey examined three key aspects of metacognition: 1) the extent to which you **plan** before you learn, 2) how frequently you **monitor** or keep track of your learning, and 3) the extent to which you **reflect on and evaluate** your learning. 

Your score for metacognition was in the **middle range**, which suggests there is room for improving your planning, monitoring, and/or evaluation skills. Please click on the **More Info** buttons to learn how to improve these skills.
