Metacognition is thinking about your thinking. It involves being aware of your thinking and controlling how you approach learning. The SRL survey examined three key aspects of metacognition: 1) the extent to which you plan before you learn, 2) how frequently you monitor or keep track of your learning, and 3) the extent to which you reflect on and evaluate your learning. 

Your score for metacognition was in the middle range, which suggests there is room for improvement. Here are a few ideas for bringing your metacognition to the next level:

* **Monitor your thinking:** As you work, pause every now and again (setting a timer will help you remember to pause) to ask yourself three important questions: 1) What am I doing? 2) Why am I doing it? and 3) How does it help me? Directed toward your mental processes, these questions can make you more aware of your thinking and what you need to do to make it as efficient as possible.

* **Reflect on the appropriateness of learning strategies and adjust as necessary:** At the start of every task, be aware of the learning strategies that you plan to use and why they are appropriate. At the completion of the task, evaluate your methods.
