Metacognition is thinking about your thinking. It involves being aware of your thoughts and controlling how you approach learning. The SRL assessment examined three key aspects of metacognition: 1) the extent to which you **plan** before you learn, 2) how frequently you **monitor** or keep track of your learning, and 3) the extent to which you **reflect on and evaluate** your learning. 

Your score for metacognition was in the **low range**, which means that you do not typically plan ahead, monitor yourself when learning, or evaluate the best approaches to learn. Please click on the **More Info** buttons to learn how to improve these skills.
