Metacognition is thinking about your thinking. It involves being aware of your thoughts and controlling how you approach learning. The SRL survey examined three key aspects of metacognition: 1) the extent to which you **plan** before you learn, 2) how frequently you **monitor** or keep track of your learning, and 3) the extent to which you **reflect** on and evaluate your learning. 

Your score for metacognition was **low**, which means that you do not typically plan ahead, monitor yourself when learning, or evluate the best approaches to learn. You can learn more about improving these skills by clicking further.
