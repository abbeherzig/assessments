Metacognition is thinking about your thinking. It involves being aware of your thoughts and controlling your approach to learning. The SRL survey examined three critical aspects of metacognition: The extent to which you plan before you learn, how frequently you monitor or keep track of your learning, and whether or not you reflect on and evaluate how you learned. 

Your score for metacognition was high.
