Metacognition is thinking about your thinking. It involves being aware of your thoughts and controlling how you approach learning. The SRL survey examined three key aspects of metacognition: 1) the extent to which you **plan** before you learn, 2) how frequently you **monitor** or keep track of your learning, and 3) the extent to which you **reflect** on and evaluate your learning. 

Your score for metacognition was in the **high range**, which suggests you often do things like planning, monitoring, and evaluating yourself. You can learn even more about these skills by clicking further.
