## Metacognition

Your metacognition score is high, suggesting that you have a strong set of the metacognitive strategies necessary to succeed in college-level work. You might be ready to up your game by using some relatively sophisticated metacognitive strategies such as the following:<ul> <li> <b>Make connections, draw inferences, and elaborate:</b> Challenge yourself to make connections, draw inferences and elaborate on the material. This will help to solidify the information so it is not only understood, but retained for future use. For example, after reading a chapter or going to a lecture on infections, apply what you have learned to a time when you or someone you know had an infection. Doing so adds relevance to abstract ideas and creates networks in your brain that make the information more accessible.</li><br><li> <b>Summarize and/or diagram:</b> Challenge yourself to recreate information in your own words or diagrams. This will help to solidify the information so it is not only understood, but understood at a deeper level, and retained for future use because you have deeply processed the information. Depending on your preference, there are a couple of ways this can be done: consider representing or mapping the material in hierarchies, sequences, matrices, diagrams, or whatever is appropriate to the information you are representing. Another idea is to not only copy important text but summarize information in a condensed way (e.g., seven words).</li><br> </ul>
