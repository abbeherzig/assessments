## Metacognition

Your metacognition score is high, suggesting that you have a strong set of the strategies necessary to succeed in college-level work. You might be ready to up your game by using some sophisticated metacognitive strategies that involve the deep processing of information, such as the following:

* **Make connections, draw inferences, and elaborate:** Challenge yourself to think deeply about what you are learning by making connections, drawing inferences, and elaborating on material. This will help to solidify the information in your mind so it is understood and remembered. For example, after reading a chapter or going to a lecture on infections, think about how to apply what you learned to a time when you or someone you know had an infection. Doing so adds relevance to abstract ideas and creates networks in your brain that make the information more accessible.

* **Summarize and/or diagram:** Challenge yourself to recreate information in your own words or diagrams. There are a couple of ways this can be done: One way is to map the material in hierarchies, sequences, matrices, diagrams, or whatever is appropriate to the information you are representing. Another way is to not simply copy important text but to summarize information in a condensed way (e.g., oly seven words).
