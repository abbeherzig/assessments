## Metacognition

Students who are successful in college are often aware of their own thinking before, during, and after a learning task. They maintain a **meta** level of awareness about how well they learn and the potential things they need to change in order to improve. These skills are what many would call your metacognition.

You might be ready to up your game by using some sophisticated metacognitive strategies that involve the deep processing of information.
