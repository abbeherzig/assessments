## Metacognition

Your metacognition score is in the medium range, suggesting that you have some of the metacognitive skills important to completing college-level work and enhancing learning. Metacognition tends to wax and wane as a semester progresses, however, so it is important to monitor and manage, and take a different approach when you feel like the strategies you are using no longer seem to be working. Here are a few ideas for monitoring, managing, and bringing your metacognitive strategies to the next level:

* **Monitor your thinking:** As you work, pause every now and again (setting a timer will help you remember to pause) to ask yourself three important questions: 1) What am I doing? 2) Why am I doing it? and 3) How does it help me? Directed toward your mental processes, these questions can make you more aware of your thinking and what you need to do to make it as efficient as possible.

* **Reflect on the appropriateness of learning strategies and adjust as necessary:** At the start of every task, be aware of the learning strategies that you plan to use, and rationalize why they are appropriate. At the completion of the task, evaluate your methods.
