## Metacognition

Your metacognition score is in the medium range, suggesting that you have some of the metacognitive skills important to completing college-level work and enhancing learning. Metacognition tends to wax and wane as a semester progresses, however, so it is important to monitor and manage, and take a different approach when you feel like the strategies you are using no longer seem to be working.
