## Metacognition

Students who are successful in college often use metacognitive skills including planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Metacognitive skills are important because they help students stay aware of and take control over how they approach and react to learning tasks.

Your metacognition score was in the **medium range**, which suggests that you have some of the metacognitive skills needed to learn and complete college-level work. The more you are able to take control of your thinking, the better you will be able to understand things more deeply, remember them longer, and do better in school. Improving these skills will also help you find that you can **reflect** on the appropriateness of learning strategies and **adjust** as needed.
