## Monitoring

Monitoring is one aspect of metacognition. Your responses to the SRL survey indicate that you **frequently** monitor while you learn. Thus, you seem to be aware of when something is challenging for you and or when you are not performing at a desired level. Keeping a high level of awareness about your thinking is important because it lets you know when and how you might need to adjust to improve your learning.
