## Monitoring

Monitoring is one aspect of a term we call *metacognition* -- your level awareness and control over your thinking. Two other areas of metacognition are planning and evaluation. The SRL survey examined all three of these areas.

The SRL survey showed that you are a **frequent** monitor. This is a very positive thing because it means that you often use strategies to keep track of how well you are learning. You seem to be in tune to when something is challenging for you and or when are not performing at a desired level. Being aware of your thinking in this way is so important because it helps you reflect on how you might change or adjust to improve your learning.

Keep up the good work! 

To continue being a **frequent self-monitor** when performing schoolwork:

1.	Ask yourself questions (Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?) 
2.	Write down or record things that you do well and that you struggle to do
