## Monitoring

Monitoring is one aspect of metacognition. Being a **frequent** monitor is very positive because it means that you often keep track of how well you are learning. You seem to be tuned in to when something is challenging for you and or when are not performing at a desired level. Being aware of your thinking is important because it helps you notice when you need to change or adjust to improve your learning.
