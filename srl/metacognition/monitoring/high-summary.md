Your scores indicate that you **frequently** monitor your thinking and learning. Thus, you may do things like writing down things that are difficult for you or keeping track of you how you perform on an assignment. These types of things help keep you aware of important things to focus on when learning.

To continue being a **frequent monitor**, consider using the following strategies:

1.	Ask yourself questions as you listen to lectures, read text, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
2.	Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Click on **More Info** for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.
