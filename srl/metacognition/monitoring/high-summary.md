Your scores indicate that you **frequently** monitor your thinking and learning. To continue being a frequent monitor:

1.	Ask yourself questions as you listen to lectures, read text, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
2.	Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Click on More Info for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.
