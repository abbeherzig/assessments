You are someone who **frequently** monitors what you do in school. This means that you often keep track of how well you learn and what you do during learning.  

To continue being a frequent monitor of yourself:

1.	Ask yourself questions (Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?) 
2.	Write down or record things that you do well and that you struggle to do
