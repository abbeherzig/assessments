Your responses to the SRL assessment suggest that you **sometimes** monitor the thinking and learning you do for school. Because self-monitoring is known to deepen and speed up learning and to keep you aware of important things to focus on during learning, you could benefit from learning more about the monitoring process.  

To **increase the frequency** of your self-monitoring:   

1.	Ask yourself these questions while you listen to lectures, read texts, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
2.	Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Click on **More Info** for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.
