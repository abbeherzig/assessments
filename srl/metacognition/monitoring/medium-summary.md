Your responses to the SRL survey suggest that you **sometimes** monitor the thinking and learning you do for school. Because self-monitoring is known to both deepen and speed up learning, you could benefit from being more consistent in keeping track of how well you learn and what you actually do during learning.  

To increase the frequency of your self-monitoring:   

1.	Ask yourself these questions while you listen to lectures, read texts, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
2.	Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Click on More Info for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.
