You are someone who **sometimes** monitors what you do in school. This means that you occasionally might keep track of how well you learn or what you do during learning.  

To increase the frequency of your self-monitoring:   

1.	Ask yourself questions (Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?) 
2.	Write down or record things that you do well and that you struggle to do.
