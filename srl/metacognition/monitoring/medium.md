## Monitoring

Monitoring is one aspect of metacognition. The SRL survey results suggests that you **occasionally** monitor yourself when learning. Thus, you sometimes track how well you learn or perform a task and may be aware of the challenges you encounter. But perhaps you do not do these things  as much as you need to. Being aware of your thinking is important because it can let you know when and how you might need to adjust to improve your learning.

These scenarios illusrate how using monitoring strategies can improve your learning experience and help you avoid wasting time:

> Jose, a third year college student, is currently enrolled in an online biology course. There are a lot of assigned readings for the class, and Jose tries to get through them as quickly as he can-â€“without stopping to make sure he understands what he is reading. Often, after reading an entire book chapter, he will think, "What did I just read?" By the next day, Jose has usually forgotten what he read the night before, but he  keeps doing the readings this way because he has so much to cover. 
> 
> Sandra, Jose's classmate, also struggles to complete all the class readings, but she makes sure to pause and monitor her level of understanding of the reading. As she reads, Sandra highlights a word on the page that was confusing or marks an entire paragraph that was not clear. She also writes down questions after completing the reader, to mind herself about what to ask her classmates or instructor. Tracking these types of things help increase Sandra's confidence to learn well in the class.
