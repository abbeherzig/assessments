## Monitoring

Monitoring is one aspect of metacognition. The SRL survey results suggests that you are a **partial** monitor: You reported sometimes using strategies to keep track of how well you learn or perform during a task, but you also might not be tuned in to things that are challenging or when you are not performing at a desired level. Increase your awareness of your thinking can help you to identify when you  need to make adjustments to improve your learning. 

These scenarios illusrate how using monitoring strategies can improve your learning experience and help you avoid wasting time:

> Jose, a third year college student, is currently enrolled in an online biology course. There are a lot of assigned readings for the class, and Jose tries to get through them as quickly as he can-â€“without stopping to make sure he understands what he is reading. Often, after reading an entire book chapter, he will think, "What did I just read?" By the next day, Jose has usually forgotten what he read the night before, but he  keeps doing the readings this way because he has so much to cover. 
> 
> Sandra, Jose's classmate, also struggles to complete all the class readings, but she makes sure to monitor her learning carefully so she only has to read everything once. She stops at the end of every section to ask herself, "Do I understand what I just read?" If she realizes that she is unclear about a topic, she tries a new strategy, such as creating a visual summary of the information or looking for an online video that can help her. When she finishes a reading assignment, Sandra is confident that she knows the material and has met her learning goals.
