## Monitoring

Monitoring is one aspect of metacognition. The SRL survey results suggests that you **occasionally** monitor yourself when learning. Thus, you sometimes track how well you learn or perform a task and may be aware of the challenges you encounter, but perhaps you do not do these things  as much as you need to. Becoming more aware of your thinking can let you know when and how you might need to change up your study approaches to improve your learning.

The following two scenarios illustrate the value of effective self-monitoring:

> Jose, a third year college student, is currently enrolled in an online biology course. There are a lot of assigned readings for the class, and Jose tries to get through them as quickly as he can-â€“without stopping to make sure he understands what he is reading. Often, after reading an entire book chapter, he will think, "What did I just read?" By the next day, Jose has usually forgotten what he read the night before, but he  keeps doing the readings this way because he has so much to cover. 
> 
> Sandra, Jose's classmate, also struggles to complete all the class readings, but she makes sure to pause and monitor her level of understanding of the reading. As she reads, Sandra highlights a word on the page that was confusing or marks an entire paragraph that was not clear. She also writes down questions after completing the reading to remind herself what she needs to ask her classmates or instructor. Tracking these types of things helps to increase Sandra's confidence and her ability to learn in the class.

A key thing that distinguished Sandra and Jose was that Sandra frequently monitored how she was learning. She also kept track of the things that were confusing or challenging, which helped her seek out the help she needed. Just remember that becoming a more effective monitor is something that can be learned and improved.
