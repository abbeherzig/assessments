## Monitoring

Monitoring is one aspect of a term we call metacognition -- your level awareness and control over your thinking. Two other areas of metacognition are planning and evaluation. The SRL survey examined all three of these areas.

The SRL survey showed that you are a **partial** monitor. Thus, you might sometimes use strategies to keep track of how well you learn or perform during a task. At times, you also may not be in tune to things that are challenging or when you are not performing at a desired level. Increase your awareness about yourself is important because it can help you to identify when and how you might need to change adjust to improve your learning. 

Read the scenarios below to see how using monitoring strategies can potentially change your learning experience.

> Jose, a third year college student, is currently enrolled in an online Biology course. There are a lot of assigned readings for the class, and Jose tries to get through them as quickly as he can – without stopping to make sure he understands what he is reading. Often, after reading an entire book chapter, he will think, "What did I just read?" By the next day, Jose has usually forgotten what he read the night before, but he just keeps doing the readings because he has so much to cover. 
> 
> Sandra, Jose’s classmate, also tries to complete the class readings, but she makes sure to monitor her learning carefully. She stops at the end of every section to ask herself, "Do I understand what I just read?" If Sandra realizes that she is confused about a topic, she tries a new strategy, such as creating a visual summary of the information or looking for an online video that can help her. When she finishes a reading assignment, Sandra is confident that she knows the material and has met her learning goals.

To increase the frequency of your self-monitoring: 

1.	Ask yourself questions (Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?) 
2.	Write down or record things that you do well and that you struggle to do
