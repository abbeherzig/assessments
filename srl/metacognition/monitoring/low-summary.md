Your scored suggests that you **infrequently** monitor what you do for school by keeping track of how well you learn or what you do during learning.  

To increase the frequency of your self-monitoring:   

1.	Ask yourself these questions while you listen to lectures, read texts, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
2.	Write down or record things that you do well and that you struggle to do.
