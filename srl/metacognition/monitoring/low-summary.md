Your responses to the SRL survey indicate that you **do not frequently** self-monitor or keep track of how well you learn or what you do during learning. When students do not monitor their thoughts and behaviors during learning, they will often lack awareness about what needs to be improved or changed. To increase the frequency of your **self-monitoring**:   

1.	Ask yourself these questions while you listen to lectures, read texts, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
2.	Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Click on More Info for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.
