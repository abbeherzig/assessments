Your score suggests that you **infrequently** monitor what you do for school by keeping track of how well you learn or what you do during learning.  

To increase the frequency of your self-monitoring:   

1.	Ask yourself these questions while you listen to lectures, read texts, and watch videos: "Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?"
2.	Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Click on More Info for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.
