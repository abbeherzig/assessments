## Metacognition
Students who are successful in college often use **metacognitive skills** including planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Metacognitive skills are important because they help students stay aware of and take control over how they approach and react to learning tasks.

Your score on the metacognition scale suggests that you do not tend to use metacognitive skills as frequently as you could be. The more you are able to take control of your thinking, the better you will be able to understand things more deeply, remember them longer, and do better in school. Improving these skills will also help you find that you can **reflect** on the appropriateness of learning strategies and **adjust** as needed.
