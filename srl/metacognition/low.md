## Metacognition
Students who are successful in college are often aware of their own thinking before, during, and after a learning task. They maintain a **meta** level of awareness about how well they learn and the potential things they need to change in order to improve. These skills are what many would call metacognition. 

Your score for the metacognition scale suggests you tend not to be as metacognitive as you could be. The more you are able to take control of your thinking, the better you will be able to understand things more deeply, remember them longer, and do better in school. Improving these skills will also help you find that you can **reflect** on the appropriateness of learning strategies and **adjust** as needed.
