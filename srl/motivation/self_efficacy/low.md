## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy refers to a person’s beliefs and confidence in their ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task, and learners may have different self-efficacy for things like studying, writing an essay, or other academic tasks. 

The SRL survey showed that you have **low** *self-efficacy for online learning*. This means that you often do not have much confidence in your ability to learn and to figure things out in an online context; you may doubt your abilities, avoid online work, or give up quickly when you encounter challenges.
Read the following scenario to get a better sense of how low self-efficacy can affect students’ thinking and feeling.

> Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she possesses strong self-efficacy for reading, she was afraid that she wouldn’t understand the biology concepts without meeting face to face with an instructor to explain things – science had never been her strongest subject. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the topic. "I may as well give up now," she thought, "Maybe this was a mistake."

Having low self-efficacy is not what you want but it is not something to feel badly about. The reason is because it is somewhat under your control and it can be improved. There are many ways to increase your confidence when working in an online environment. 

A few strategies to improve your self-efficacy:

1.	Use positive self-talk when you encounter difficulties
2.	Practice completing assignments and quiz yourself when learning information
3.	Remind yourself about all of the things that you do well in school
