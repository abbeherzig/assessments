## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy is your confidence in your ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task so, for example, you might have high self-efficacy for a math test but low self-efficacy for public speaking, or vice versa. 

The SRL survey suggests that you have **low** *self-efficacy for online learning*. This might mean that you doubt your abilities, avoid online work, or give up quickly when you encounter challenges. The following scenario illustrates how low self-efficacy can affect a person's thoughts, feelings, and actions.

> Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she has strong self-efficacy for reading, science had never been her strongest subject and she was afraid that she wouldn't understand  biology concepts without meeting face-to-face with an instructor. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the material. "I may as well give up now," she thought, "Maybe this was a mistake."

Students like Maria have many self-doubts when learning, which can cause them to give up prematurely and to avoid things. The key thing that Maria needs are opportunities to practice working online so that she can experience some success. As students become more confident they tend to try harder, persist longer, and perform better in school.

Having low self-efficacy is not ideal--but it is not something to feel badly about. These beliefs can be changed and are somewhat under your control.
