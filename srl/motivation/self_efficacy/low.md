## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy refers to your confidence in your ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task so, for example, you might have high self-efficacy for a math test but low self-efficacy for public speaking, or vice versa. 

The SRL survey suggests that you have **low** *self-efficacy for online learning*. This might mean that you doubt your abilities, avoid online work, or give up quickly when you encounter challenges. The following scenario illustrates how low self-efficacy can affect a person's thoughts, feelings, and actions.

> Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she has strong self-efficacy for reading, science had never been her strongest subject and she was afraid that she wouldnâ€™t understand the biology concepts without meeting face to face with an instructor. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the topic. "I may as well give up now," she thought, "Maybe this was a mistake."

Having low self-efficacy is not ideal because it tends to lead to frustration and giving up--but it is not something to feel badly about because it is somewhat under your control: Self-efficacy can be improved.
