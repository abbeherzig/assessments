## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy is your level of confidence in your ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task so, for example, you might have high self-efficacy for a math test but low self-efficacy for public speaking, or vice versa. 

The SRL assessment suggests that you have **high** *self-efficacy for online learning*. That means you probably feel capable of performing well in an online environment. This is great, because high self-efficacy leads people to try hard, persist, and succeed.
