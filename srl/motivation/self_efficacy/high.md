## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy refers to a personâ€™s beliefs and confidence in their ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task, and learners may have different self-efficacy for things like studying, writing an essay, or other academic tasks. 

The SRL survey showed that you have **high** *self-efficacy for online learning*. Thus, you will often feel capable of displaying the behaviors needed to perform well in an online environment. This is great! Keep up the good work! 

Although you have high levels of confidence in your ability to learn online, it is important to think about how to sustain that level of confidence. When your confidence is high, you will likely try harder, persist longer, and perform better in school than learners who are not as confident. 

A few strategies to maintain your high self-efficacy:

1.	Use positive self-talk when you encounter difficulties
2.	Practice completing assignments and quiz yourself when learning information
3.	Remind yourself about all of the things that you do well in school
