Your self-efficacy for online learning is **low**, meaning you do not have much confidence and will often doubt your ability to learn in an online context. Improving your self-efficacy is important because it can help you to stay motivated and to persist when something is hard for you.

A few strategies to improve your self-efficacy:

1.	Use positive self-talk when you encounter difficulties
2.	Practice completing assignments and quiz yourself when learning information
3.	Remind yourself about all of the things that you do well in school
