## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy refers to a person’s beliefs and confidence in their ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task, and learners may have different self-efficacy for things like studying, writing an essay, or other academic tasks. 

The SRL survey showed that you have **medium** *self-efficacy for online learning*. Thus, you will sometimes feel capable of displaying the behaviors needed to perform well in an online environment. In your situation, it may be that your confidence goes up or down depending on the particular topic or activity you are completing online. 

Read the scenario below to get a better feel for how inconsistent or low self-efficacy for online learning can impact Maria’s performance.

> Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she possesses strong self-efficacy for reading, she was afraid that she wouldn’t understand the biology concepts without meeting face to face with an instructor to explain things – science had never been her strongest subject. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the topic. "I may as well give up now," she thought, "Maybe this was a mistake."

You have some confidence in your abilities for online learning, which is great! But an important thing to think about is how you can become even more confident in yourself. In general, students who have higher confidence tend to try hard, persist longer, and perform better in school.

A few strategies to improve your self-efficacy:

1.	Use positive self-talk when you encounter difficulties
2.	Practice completing assignments and quiz yourself when learning information
3.	Remind yourself about all of the things that you do well in school
