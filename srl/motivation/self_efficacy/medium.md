## Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy is your level of confidence in your ability to do something. Self-efficacy is specific to a certain task so, for example, you might have high self-efficacy for math test but low self-efficacy for public speaking, or vice versa. 

The SRL assessment suggests that you have **medium** *self-efficacy for online learning*. That means you *sometimes* feel capable of performing well in an online environment. It is possible that your confidence goes up or down depending on the particular topic or activity you are completing online. 

The scenario below illustrates how self-efficacy for online learning can influence a person's thoughts, feelings, and actions.

> Maria, a first year college student, was hesitant about enrolling in an online biology course. Although she possesses strong self-efficacy for reading, science had never been her strongest subject and she was afraid that she wouldn't understand biology concepts without meeting face-to-face with an instructor. The first class module was difficult for Maria, and she had a hard time understanding the material. "I may as well give up now," she thought, "Maybe this was a mistake."

Students like Maria have many self-doubts when learning, which can cause them to give up prematurely and to avoid things. The key thing that Maria needs are opportunities to practice working online so that she can experience some success. As students become more confident they tend to try harder, persist longer, and perform better in school.
