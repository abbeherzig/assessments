Your level of mastery orientation is **low**. It seems that you don’t typically enjoy learning in school and may not see how schoolwork is relevant to your life. You might work hard at school for other reasons beside the joy of learning.

To improve your mastery orientation, you can:

1.	Don’t worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. 
2.	Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
3.	View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
