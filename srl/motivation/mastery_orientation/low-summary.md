Your score for mastery orientation is **low**. It seems that you donâ€™t typically enjoy learning in school and may not see how schoolwork is relevant to your life. If you work hard at school, it is probably for reasons unrelated to the joy of learning.

To improve your mastery orientation, you can:

1.	Not worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. 
2.	Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
3.	View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
