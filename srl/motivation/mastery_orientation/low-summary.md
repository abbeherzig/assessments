Your score for mastery orientation was **low**. It seems that you don't typically enjoy learning in school and may not see how schoolwork is relevant to your life. If you work hard at school, it is probably for reasons unrelated to the joy of learning.

To enhance mastery-oriented thinking (and to avoid performance-oriented thinking): 

1.	Don't worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. 
2.	Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
3.	View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
