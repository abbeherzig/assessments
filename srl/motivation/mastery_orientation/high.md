## Mastery Orientation

Goal orientation refers to the reasons people engage in learning.  People with a **mastery orientation** want to master skills and gain knowledge. In contrast, people with a **performance orientation** want to perform well so they appear intelligent or capable to others. Most people have a combination of both types of goal orientation, but good learners tend to be more mastery oriented. 

The scenario below illustrates the distinction between mastery orientation and the less adaptive performance orientation.

> Janet and Rick are classmates in an Introductory Psychology course. With the midterm exam just a week away, both learners are spending a lot of time studying, but for very different reasons. Rick thinks, "This material is fascinating, and I really want to master the basics so that I can take a more advanced course next semester." [mastery orientation] Janet, on the other hand, says to herself, "I better do well on this exam so that I don't come across as dumb or stupid." [performance orientation]

The distinction bewteen a mastery and performance orientation may seem like a very minor thing, but it is actually quite important. For Rick, learning is often fun and interesting, whereas for Janet, it can be anxiety-provoking and overwhelming.
