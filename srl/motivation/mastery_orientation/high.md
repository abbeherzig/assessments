## Mastery Orientation

Goal orientation refers to the reasons individuals engage in a learning task.  Individuals with a **mastery orientation** want to master skills and gain knowledge. In contrast, individuals with a **performance orientation** want to perform well so they appear intelligent or capable to others. Most people have a combination of both types of goal orientation, but good learners tend to be more mastery oriented. The scenario below illustrates the distinction between mastery orientation and the less adaptive performance orientation.

> Janet and Rick are classmates in an Introductory Psychology course. With the midterm exam just a week away, both learners are spending a lot of time studying, but for very different reasons. Rick thinks, "This material is fascinating, and I really want to master the basics so that I can take a more advanced course next semester." [mastery orientation] Janet, on the other hand, says to herself, "I better do well on this exam so that I don’t come across as dumb or stupid." [performance orientation]

The SRL survey focused on mastery orientation. Your results suggest that you have high mastery orientation, which is fabulous! This means that you are motivated to work hard because you enjoy learning and want to gain knowledge and skills. Maintaining a mastery orientation will help keep you motivated to learn and work hard in school.

To sustain your high mastery-oriented thinking (and to avoid performance-oriented thinking): 

1.	Don’t worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. 
2.	Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
3.	View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
