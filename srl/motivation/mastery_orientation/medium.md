## Mastery Orientation

Goal orientation refers to the reasons why individuals decide to engage in a learning task. Individuals with a **mastery orientation** want to master skills and gain knowledge. In contrast, individuals with a **performance orientation** want to perform well so that they appear intelligent or capable to others. Read the scenario below to help you more clearly see the distinction between mastery orientation and the less adaptive performance orientation.

> Janet and Rick are classmates in an Introductory Psychology course. With the midterm exam just a week away, both learners are spending a lot of time studying, but for very different reasons. Rick thinks, "This material is fascinating, and I really want to master the basics so that I can take a more advanced course next semester."[mastery orientation] Janet, on the other hand, says to herself, "I better do well on this exam so that I don’t come across as dumb or stupid." [performance orientation]

The SRL survey focused on mastery orientation. Based on the results, it appears that you have medium mastery orientation. This suggests that your enjoyment of learning or your desire to gain knowledge and skills are sometimes part of the reason reason why you want to do your school work. 

It’s great that you sometimes think like a mastery orientated learner, but you may find school more enjoyable and interesting if you further develop mastery-oriented way of thinking. 

To enhance mastery-oriented thinking (and to avoid performance-oriented thinking): 

1.	Don’t worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. 
2.	Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
3.	View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
