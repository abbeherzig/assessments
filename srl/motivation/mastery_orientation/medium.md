## Mastery Orientation

Goal orientation refers to the reasons people engage in a learning task.  People with a **mastery orientation** want to master skills and gain knowledge. In contrast, people with a **performance orientation** want to perform well so they appear intelligent or capable to others. Most people have a combination of both types of goal orientation, but good learners tend to be more mastery oriented. 

The scenario below illustrates the distinction between mastery orientation and the less adaptive performance orientation.

> Janet and Rick are classmates in an Introductory Psychology course. With the midterm exam just a week away, both learners are spending a lot of time studying, but for very different reasons. Rick thinks, "This material is fascinating, and I really want to master the basics so that I can take a more advanced course next semester." [mastery orientation] Janet, on the other hand, says to herself, "I better do well on this exam so that I don't come across as dumb or stupid." [performance orientation]

The distinction bewteen a mastery and performance orientation may seem like a very minor thing, but it is actually quite important. For Rick, learning is often fun and interesting, whereas for Janet, it can be anxiety-provoking and overwhelming.

The SRL survey focused only on **mastery orientation**. Your results suggest that you exhibit **some tendencies** of a mastery orientation. This suggests that your enjoyment of learning and your desire to gain knowledge and skills are sometimes part of the reason you want to do your school work-but not always. You might find school more enjoyable and interesting if you further develop a mastery-oriented way of thinking.
