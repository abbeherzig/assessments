Your score for mastery orientation suggests that there are occasions when you enjoy learning just for the sake of learning and when you work hard  because you want to master skills and gain knowledge--but not always.

To enhance mastery-oriented thinking (and to avoid performance-oriented thinking): 

1.	Don't worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. 
2.	Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade.
3.	View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.
