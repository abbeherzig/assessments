## Motivation

**Motivation** involves the desire to act. It includes behaviors such as choosing to study when there are more fun things to do, giving strong effort to get good grades, and persisting when challenged. Students will dislay these types of motivated behaviors for a variety of reasons. Some of the most important of these influences include motivation beliefs and perceptions, such as **self-efficacy**, **goal orientation**, **mindset**, and **test anxiety**. The SRL survey that you recently completed addressed each of these four motivation beliefs.   

Your overall score in Motivation was **Emerging**. This could mean one of two things. First, your profile of scores across self-efficacy, goal orienation, mindset, and test anxiety was fairly consistent and in the medium or emerging level (not too high but not too low). The second possibility is that your profile may be uneven. Scores for some motivation beliefs may be high, yet others are low. Below, take a look at all four motivation beliefs. Click on those areas that seem to be lower than others or on areas that are of particular interest to you. By clicking on each of the motivation beliefs, you can learn how to enhance or improve them.
