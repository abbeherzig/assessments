## Motivation

The level of **Motivation** that students display is influenced by many different factors, such as their **self-efficacy**, **goal orientation**, **mindset**, and **test anxiety**. In this section, you will have an opportunity to learn about your level of motivational beliefs in these four areas.

Your overall score in Motivation was **Emerging**. This could mean one of two things. First, it is possible that your profile of scores across the four areas was fairly consistent and in the medium or emerging level (not too high but not too low). The second possibility is that your profile may be unevenly developed, meaning that your scores for some motivational beliefs may be high, yet others may be low. Below, take a look at all four motivation beliefs. Click on those areas that seem to be lower than others or on areas that are of particular interest to you. By clicking on each of the motivation beliefs, you can learn how to enhance or improve them.
