## Test Anxiety

Test anxiety is experienced as negative thoughts (worries, fears), uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings (anxiety), and physical reactions (increased pulse rate). The SRL survey results suggest that you have a **medium level of test anxiety**. This means that from time to time you might worry about how you will perform on a test. Your anxiety might also sometimes cause you to feel on edge, or might make it hard for you to focus on your work. 

This scenario illustrates how having a lot of test anxiety can make it hard to study and perform well:

> Sal, a second year college student, immediately begins to have negative thoughts at the mention of any exam; he believes he's going to fail. Sal worries so much that he often finds it difficult to concentrate while studying or during an exam. As his next math test approaches, he feels extremely nervous about failing. He thinks, â€œIt doesn't matter how much I study. There's no way I'm going to pass this exam, or this class.

Although anxiety like Sal's can be debilitating, the good news is that there are many ways to lower test anxiety and improve performance.
