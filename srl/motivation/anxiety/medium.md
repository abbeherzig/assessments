## Test Anxiety

Test Anxiety represents an experience where people have negative thoughts (worries, fears) that present as uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings (anxiety) and physical reactions (increased pulse rate). The SRL survey showed that you have a medium level of test anxiety. This means that from time to time you may worry about how you will perform in school. Your anxiety might also sometimes cause you to feel “on edge” or might make it hard for you to focus and concentrate on your work. 

Read the scenario to see an example of how having a lot of test anxiety can affect a student’s performance.

> Sal, a second year college student, was feeling extremely nervous about failing his math exam. At the mention of any exam, Sal immediately begins to have negative thoughts -- he believes he’s going to fail, and often questions his ability to pass the exam and class. Sal worries so much that he often finds it difficult to not only concentrate on the exam, but to complete homework and classwork. As his next math test approached, he thought, “It doesn’t matter how much I study, I don’t know anything. There’s no way I’m going to pass this exam, or this class.

It’s great that you did not rate your test anxiety as being high. Just remember that if you do become anxious or worry in school, you can:

1.	Use relaxation techniques to reduce uncomfortable feelings and to increase your focus. 
2.	Learn how to say positive things to yourself.
3.	Create schedules for yourself and plan.
