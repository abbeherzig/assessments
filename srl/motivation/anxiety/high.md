## Test Anxiety

Test Anxiety represents an experience where people have negative thoughts (worries, fears) that present as uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings (anxiety) and physical reactions (increased pulse rate). The SRL survey showed that you have a low level of test anxiety. That is good news! You may occasionally feel nervous about an exam, but it appears that you donâ€™t worry excessively or let negative thoughts and feelings affect your performance. 

Keep up the good work! Managing your anxiety to keep it at a low level is important for your success at school. Just remember, if you do become anxious you can:

1.	Use relaxation techniques to reduce uncomfortable feelings and to increase your focus. 
2.	Learn how to say positive things to yourself.

Create schedules for yourself and plan.
