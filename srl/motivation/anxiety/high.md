## Test Anxiety

Test Anxiety is experienced as negative thoughts (worries, fears), uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings (anxiety), and physical reactions (increased pulse rate). The SRL survey results suggest that you have a low level of test anxiety. That is good news! You may occasionally feel nervous about an exam, but it appears that you donâ€™t worry enough to let negative thoughts and feelings affect your performance. 

Keep up the good work! If you do become anxious you can:

1.	Use relaxation techniques to reduce uncomfortable feelings and to increase your focus. 
2.	Learn how to say positive things to yourself.
3.  Create schedules and plan, so you don't worry about getting everything done.
