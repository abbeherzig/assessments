## Test Anxiety

Test Anxiety represents an experience where people have negative thoughts (worries, fears) that present as uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings (anxiety) and physical reactions (increased pulse rate). The SRL survey showed that you have a high level of test anxiety. This means that you tend to worry a lot about how you will perform when studying or taking an exam. You may also feel “on edge” or have trouble focusing or concerning on schoolwork at because of your worrying. 

Read the following scenario to get a better sense of students who experience high test anxiety.

> Sal, a second year college student, was feeling extremely nervous about failing his math exam. At the mention of any exam, Sal immediately begins to have negative thoughts -- he believes he’s going to fail, and often questions his ability to pass the exam and class. Sal worries so much that he often finds it difficult to not only concentrate on the exam, but to complete homework and classwork. As his next math test approached, he thought, “It doesn’t matter how much I study, I don’t know anything. There’s no way I’m going to pass this exam, or this class.

The good news is that there are many ways in which you can lower your anxiety in school and to improve your performance! 

To lower your test anxiety, you can:

1.	Use relaxation techniques to reduce uncomfortable feelings and to increase your focus.
