## Anxiety

Test anxiety is experienced as negative thoughts (worries, fears), uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings (anxiety), and physical reactions (increased pulse rate). The SRL assessment results suggest that you have a **high level of test anxiety**. This means that you tend to worry a lot about how you will perform on exams. You might also feel on edge or have trouble focusing on schoolwork because of worrying. 

The following scenario might seem familiar to you:

> Sal, a second year college student, immediately begins to have negative thoughts at the mention of any exam -- he believes he's going to fail. Sal worries so much that he often finds it difficult to concentrate on an exam and to complete classwork. As his next math test approaches, he feels extremely nervous about failing. He thinks, â€œIt doesn't matter how much I study. There's no way I'm going to pass this exam, or this class."

Although anxiety like Sal's can be debilitating, the good news is that there are many ways to lower anxiety about tests and to improve performance.
