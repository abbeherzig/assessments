## Mindset

Mindset refers to your *beliefs* about whether intelligence or ability is fixed (called a fixed mindset) or can change over time (a growth mindset). Mindset refers to your *beliefs* about intelligence, not whether or not you are smart. 

The SRL survey results suggest that you have a mixed mindset: You answered some questions with a growth mindset, and others with a fixed mindset. The two scenarios below illustrate the distinctions between a fixed and growth mindset, as well as the influence of mindset on people's behavior.

> **FIXED**: Ben  received a poor grade on his science midterm and was quick to label himself as "bad at science" and "a failure". Ben decided he was not capable of doing well on the final, and no amount of effort and practice could change that: Why would he put the effort into studying if it wouldn't make a difference? Feeling defeated, Ben stopped paying attention in class and barely studied for the final exam. 

> **GROWTH**: Nicole took the same science midterm and also received a poor grade. Nicole thought she must not have studied well enough. Although she was disappointed with the grade, Nicole understood that it she could improve if she put in more effort and studied the material more thoroughly. Nicole took more detailed class notes, asked questions to clear up confusion, and studied every week using study aids to help her master the material. 

Although you might have a mixed mindset right now, you can change it to a growth mindset. That is, you can learn to think and *act* like your intelligence can be improved with effort.
