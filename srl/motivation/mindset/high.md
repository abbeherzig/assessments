## Mindset

Mindset refers to your *beliefs* about whether you think your intelligence or ability is fixed (called a **fixed mindset**) or can change over time (called a **growth mindset**). It refers to your beliefs about intelligence, not whether or not you are smart. 

The SRL survey results suggest that you have a growth mindset. This is a very positive thing because it means that you probably are not afraid of trying hard and persisting even when something is difficult, and view mistakes as a natural part of learning. The two scenarios below illustrate the distinction between a fixed and growth mindset, and how mindset influences behavior.

> **FIXED**: Ben received a poor grade on his science midterm and was quick to label himself as "bad at science" and "a failure". Ben decided he was not capable of doing well on the final, and thought that no amount of effort and practice could change that: Why would he put the effort into studying if it wouldn't make a difference? Feeling defeated, Ben stopped paying attention in class and barely studied for the final exam. 

> **GROWTH**: Nicole took the same science midterm and also received a poor grade. Nicole thought she must not have studied well enough. Although she was disappointed with the grade, Nicole understood that it she could improve if she put in more effort and studied the material more thoroughly. Nicole took more detailed class notes, asked questions to clear up confusions, and studied every week using study aids to help her master the material. 

To maintain your beneficial growth mindset:

1.	Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn, rather than something to overcome.
2.	View mistakes as a natural part of learning.
3.	Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Remind yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.
