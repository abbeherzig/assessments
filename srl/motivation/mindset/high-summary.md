You exhibit the thinking of someone with a **growth** mindset, which means that you correctly believe that your intelligence and abilities can change over time with effort: The harder you try, the more intelligent and capable you become.  

To maintain your beneficial growth mindset:

1.	Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome.
2.	View mistakes as a natural part of learning.
3.	Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Remind yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.
