Your SRL assessment results indicate that you think like someone with a **fixed** mindset, which means that you believe that your intelligence and ability cannot change, even when you try very hard. That is a disadvantageous belief, but you can develop a more beneficial **growth** mindset.

To shift from a fixed to a growth mindset:

1.	Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome.
2.	View mistakes as a natural part of learning.
3.	Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Remind yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.
