You exhibit the thinking of someone with a **Fixed** mindset, which means that you often believe that your intelligence and ability cannot change even when you try very hard..  But your Fixed mindset can be changed to a more positive mindset called Growth mindset.

To shift from a Fixed to a Growth mindset:

1.	Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome
2.	View mistakes as a natural part of learning
3.	Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Keep reminding yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.
