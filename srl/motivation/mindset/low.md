## Mindset

Mindset refers to your *beliefs* about whether your intelligence or ability is fixed (called a fixed mindset) or can change over time with effort (a growth mindset). Mindset refers to your *beliefs* about intelligence, not whether or not you are smart. 

The SRL survey results suggest that you have a **fixed mindset**, meaning you tend to believe your intelligence cannot be changed over time. Having this mindset is disadvantageous because it could lead you to avoid things that are difficult, give up when you struggle, or become anxious when you make mistakes. The two scenarios below illustrate the distinctions between a fixed and growth mindset, as well as the influence of mindset on people's behavior.

> **FIXED**: Ben received a poor grade on his science midterm and was quick to label himself as "bad at science" and "a failure". Ben decided he was not capable of doing well on the final, and no amount of effort and practice could change that: Why would he put the effort into studying if it wouldn't make a difference? Feeling defeated, Ben stopped paying attention in class and barely studied for the final exam. 

> **GROWTH**: Nicole took the same science midterm and also received a poor grade. Nicole thought she must not have studied well enough. Although she was disappointed with the grade, Nicole understood that she could improve if she put in more effort and studied the material more thoroughly. Nicole took more detailed class notes, asked questions to clear up confusion, and studied every week using study aids to help her master the material. 

Although you might have a fixed mindset right now, you can change it to a growth mindset. That is, you can learn to think and *act* like your intelligence can be improved with effort.
