You exhibit the thinking of someone with a **Mixed** mindset; that is, someone who may exhibit a Growth mindset a times (i.e., believing that intelligence can be changed with effort) and at other times exhibit a Fixed mindset (i.e., believing intelligence cannot be changed over time). It is important to focus on developing a Growth mindset.

To develop a more consistent Growth mindset:

1.	Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome
2.	View mistakes as a natural part of learning
3.	Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Keep reminding yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.
