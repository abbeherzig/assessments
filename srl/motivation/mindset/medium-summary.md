Your SRL survey results indicate that you think like someone with a **mixed** mindset: At times you believe that intelligence can be changed with effort (a **growth** mindset) but sometimes you have a **fixed** mindset (believing intelligence cannot change, even with effort). Because your mindset influences your behavior, it is important to focus on developing a growth mindset. 

To develop a solid growth mindset:

1.	Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome.
2.	View mistakes as a natural part of learning.
3.	Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Remind yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.
