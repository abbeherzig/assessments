Motivation is the desire or will to do something. When people are motivated, they invest a lot of effort, persist when challenged, and do the best job they can. The SRL survey addressed four sources of motivation: self-efficacy, goal orientation, mindset, and test anxiety. Your score suggests you have a moderate amount of motivation.
