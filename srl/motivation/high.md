## Motivation

**Motivation** involves the desire to act. It includes behaviors such as choosing to study when there are more fun things to do, giving a lot of effort to get good grades, and persisting when challenged. The extent to which students display these behaviors is often influenced by their motivation beliefs and perceptions, such as **self-efficacy**, **goal orientation**, **mindset**, and **test anxiety**. The SRL survey that you recently completed addressed each of these four motivation beliefs.  

Your overall score in Motivation was **High**. This means that your scores across across the four areas were fairly consistent and positive.
