Thank you for completing the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of Colleges (DAACS). The results presented here are meant to be informative and instructional; **there is no passing or failing**. Because your results can change due to life circumstances or courses you take, you are encourage to take SRL survey again, especially when beginning new courses.

Your responses to the SRL items suggest that you possess many of the skills necessary to be a successful learner and college student. The links on the left lead to more information about self-regulated learning skills, along with recommendations for how to further develop your self-regulation skills.
