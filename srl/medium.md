Thank you for completing the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of Colleges (DAACS). The results presented here are meant to be informative and instructional; **there is no passing or failing**. These results may change based upon the course(s) you are taking, environmental factors, or life circumstances. As such, you are encourage to take DAACS at different times and when beginning new courses.

Your responses to the SRL items suggest you are a *emerging learner* which means that while you have many strengths as a learner, there are some areas where you could possibly enhance your self-regulation skills. The links on the left will provide detailed information about the different aspects of being a self-regulated learner with recommendations on how to enhance these skills. We recommend exploring both strength areas as well as weak areas. It is good to play to your strengths while understanding and developing any possible weak areas. Rarely are people strong in all areas of self-regulation, but successful learners know how to play to their strengths.
