You are about to take the mathematics assessment. This assessment will cover six areas: geometry; lines and functions; number and calculation; statistics; variables and equations; and word problems. Remember--the goal of this assessment is to help you identify your strengths and areas for improvement. Don't be discouraged if some questions are more difficult than others. In fact, if you feel anxious about taking the math assessment, you could take the SRL survey first, use some of the strategies related to test anxiety to prepare, and then return here. 

When you take the math assessment, be sure to click the Formula button for some useful formulas. You may use a calculator during the assessment. You will also need paper and pencil. The assessment typically takes between 20 and 30 minutes to complete. You can save and return later if you cannot complete it in one sitting.

Once you complete the math assessment, you will be provided feedback about your performance in the six areas. Suggestions for resources to review will be provided along with feedback about each question.
