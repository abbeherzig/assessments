You are about to take the mathematics assessment. This assessment will cover six areas: geometry; lines and functions; number and calculation; statistics; variables and equations; and word problems. Remember the goal of this assessment is to help you identify your strengths and areas for improvement. Don't be discouraged if some questions are more difficult than others. Once you complete the assessment you will be provided feedback about your performance in the six areas. Some suggestions of resources to review will be provided along with feedback about each question. Be sure to click the Help button for some useful formulas. You may use a calculator during the assessment. The assessment typically takes between 20 and 30 minutes to complete and you can save and return later if you cannot complete in one sitting. Good luck!
