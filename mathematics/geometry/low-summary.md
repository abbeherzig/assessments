**Geometry** is the mathematical science of describing the properties of shapes, including straight and curved lines, circles, triangles,  rectangles, cubes, and spheres. We use geometry to calculate the size of shapes using perimeter, area, and volume. We also analyze the properties of shapes by studying the sizes and properties lines and angles that comprise them. A special branch of geometry called *analytic geometry* locates points on the plane using *x-y coordinates*. Using analytic geometry, we can examine the properties of straight lines and of a special type of curved line called a function, and can locate shapes and what happens to them as they are moved. 

Your results suggest that you are just developing skills for working with length, area, and volume of shapes. These two videos will help you review concepts of area and volume and how to calculate them:
