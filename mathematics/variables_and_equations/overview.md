## Variables, expressions, and equations

**Variables, expressions, and equations** are algebraic tools that describe quantities and their relationships in more general ways than we can do with numbers alone. **Variables** use letters to represent numbers that are unknown, either because we havenâ€™t figured them out yet or because we might want to use more than one number in the same way. **Expressions** are more complex quantities that combine variables and numbers, using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponents. An **equation** is a mathematical sentence that uses an equal sign to show that two expressions have the same value. This domain assesses your skills at solving problems with these building blocks of algebra.
