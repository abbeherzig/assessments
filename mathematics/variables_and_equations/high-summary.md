## Variables, expressions, and equations

**Variables, expressions, and equations** are algebraic tools that describe quantities and their relationships in more general ways than we can do with numbers alone. **Variables** use letters to represent numbers that are unknown, either because we havenâ€™t figured them out yet or because we might want to use more than one number in the same way. **Expressions** are more complex quantities that combine variables and numbers, using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponents. An **equation** is a mathematical sentence that uses an equal sign to show that two expressions have the same value. 

Your results suggest that you have mastered working with variables, representing complex quantities with expressions, and writing equivalent expressions as equations.
