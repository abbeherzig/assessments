Analytic geometry identifies points by how far they are from a starting point, called the origin, by moving horizontally left or right by some distance (the *x*-direction) and vertically up or down by a distance (the *y*-direction). The point (*x*, *y*) describes the horizontal distance *x*, and the vertical distance *y*, that the point is from the origin. We can also think of x and y as variables, which allows us to describe not only individual points, but many points at the same time. A **function** is a relationship between the two variables *x* and *y*, and a straight **line** is the most fundamental example of a function. 

Your results suggest that your skills are just developing for working with lines, other functions, and their graphs. You may want to further develop your skills in this area with some of the following tools. 

* To learn more about plotting points using x-y coordinates, start with http://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/graphing-on-the-coordinate-plane. 

* Learn more about the equation of a straight line at http://www.mathsisfun.com/equation_of_line.html and be sure to check out the interactive line graphing calculator in the middle of the page. 

* The steepness of a line is measured by a number called its slope, which is explained at http://www.mathsisfun.com/gradient.html.
