A function is a special kind of relationship between the two variables *x* and *y*, with each value of *x* associated with only one value of *y* (or sometimes no values of *y*, but never more than one). A function is usually described by an equation that tells us how to calculate the value of *y* that is associated with each *x*. For example, *y = 5x â€“ 7* is the equation of a function, because we can use it to calculate one exact value of *y* for each value of *x*. We can then graph a line or curve on the Cartesian plane (using *x-y* coordinates) that shows all the points described by that equation all at once. A straight line is the most fundamental example of a function. There are many other types of functions, including parabolas and polynomials. Lines and other functions are used to model many real-world situations like economics, engineering, and medicine.

Your results suggest that you have difficulty working with lines, other functions, and their graphs.
