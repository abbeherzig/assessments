Analytic geometry identifies points by how far they are from a starting point, called the origin, by moving horizontally left or right by some distance (the *x*-direction) and vertically up or down by a distance (the *y*-direction). The point (*x*, *y*) describes the horizontal distance *x*, and the vertical distance *y*, that the point is from the origin. We can also think of x and y as variables, which allows us to describe not only individual points, but many points at the same time. A **function** is a relationship between the two variables *x* and *y*, and a straight **line** is the most fundamental example of a function. 

Your results suggest that your skills are emerging for working with lines, other functions, and their graphs. To further develop your skills in this area, you can review a general explanation of functions at: http://mathantics.com/section/lesson-video/what-are-functions and of linear functions in particular here: http://www.virtualnerd.com/algebra-1/relations-functions/functions/linear-nonlinear/what-is-a-linear-function.
