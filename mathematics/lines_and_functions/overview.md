**Lines and Functions Domain**

Analytic geometry identifies points by how far they are from a starting point, called the origin, by moving horizontally left or right by some distance (the *x*-direction) and vertically up or down by a distance (the *y*-direction). The point (*x*, *y*) describes the horizontal distance *x*, and the vertical distance *y*, that the point is from the origin. We can also think of x and y as variables, which allows us to describe not only individual points, but many points at the same time. A **function** is a relationship between the two variables *x* and *y*, and a straight **line** is the most fundamental example of a function.
