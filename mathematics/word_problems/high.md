## Representing word problems with algebra

**Word problems** are real-world problems that can be solved using a variety of mathematical tools. While much of the mathematics you learned in school involves calculations with numbers or manipulation of variables and other symbols, the real value of mathematics lies in its power to help us understand and analyze real situations in the world around us. There are a variety of tools needed to solve problems that are posed in the form of words and stories, starting with translating the problem into mathematical language. This includes identifying and labeling quantities and writing their relationships in the form of algebraic *variables*, *expressions*, or *equations*. In some problems, once we have the algebraic representation of a problem, we then need to solve the resulting equation or do other necessary calculations. 

Not all word problems require the use of variables, expressions, and equations. Some problems are solved by doing series of calculations with numbers, organizing information in a table, drawing a picture, or looking for patterns in other ways. 

Your results suggest that you have mastery at solving word problems.
