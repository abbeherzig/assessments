## Representing Word Problems with Algebra

**Word problems** are real-world problems that can be solved using a variety of mathematical tools. While much of the mathematics you learned in school involves calculations with numbers or manipulation of variables and other symbols, the real value of mathematics lies in its power to help us understand and analyze real situations in the world around us. There are a variety of tools needed to solve word problems, starting with translating the problem into mathematical language. This includes identifying and labeling quantities and writing their relationships in the form of algebraic *variables*, *expressions*, or *equations*. In some problems, once we have the algebraic representation of a problem, we then need to solve the resulting equation or do other necessary calculations. 

Not all word problems require the use of variables, expressions, and equations. Some problems are solved by doing series of calculations with numbers, organizing information in a table, drawing a picture, or looking for patterns in other ways. 

This domain assesses your skills at solving mathematics problems that are presented in the form of words and stories. 

Your results suggest that your skills at reading and solving word problems are weak. Particular skills you might focus on include translating words into equations and other mathematical expressions, and using different strategies such as pictures, tables, and pattern-finding to solve problems.
