## Statistics

**Statistics** is the mathematics of turning data (lots of numbers) into useable information. Researchers, journalists, scientists, financial advisors, politicians, consumers, and just about everyone else use numbers all the time to measure or summarize the things they observe around them.  But what do you do with all those numbers? Data on its own usually does not tell us much. It takes specific mathematical methods to extract the meaning from the numbers. Those methods form the field of **Statistics**.

Showing data visually using scatterplots, line graphs, frequency distributions, and tables, is an important set of tools to look at and understand the data. You can understand other features of data using numeric summaries, like measures of center (mean, median, and mode), correlation, and lines of best fit. All of these tools are only helpful if you know how to read and interpret them. And since all of these statistical tools are only as good as the data that is used to produce them, you need to know the questions to ask about how the data was collected.

Your results suggest that you have emerging skills for reasoning with data. To further develop your skills at summarizing data with statistics, graphs, and tables, these resources might be a good starting point:
