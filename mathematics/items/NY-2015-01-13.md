We are told that the length of the rectangle is 3 feet
less than twice the width. Since x is the width,

Twice the width = *2x*.

3 feet less than twice the width = *2x – 3*

So the length is *2x – 3*. The area of the rectangle is a *= l x w* =
*x(2x – 3).* The problem states that the area can be *at most* 30 square
feet. Another way to say *at most 30 square feet* is to say *30 square
feet or less*. That statement can be represented as

x(2x – 3) ≤ 30.
