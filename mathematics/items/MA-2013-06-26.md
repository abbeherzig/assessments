If ΔR'S'T' resulted from translating (moving) ΔRST 3
units right and 4 units up, then we can get back to ΔRST by doing the
opposite: move ΔR'S'T' 3 units left and 4 units down.

We are only being asked to find the coordinates of point R, so let's see
what happens to R' when we undo the translation. We start with R' =
(2,3)

Moving R' 3 units left means to subtract 3 from the x-coordinate. Moving
4 units down means to subtract 4 from the y coordinate.

R = (2 – 3, 3 – 4) = (-1,-1) Which is choice D.
