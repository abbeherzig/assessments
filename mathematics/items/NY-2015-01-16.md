When the equation of a line is written in the form *y =
mx + b*, the slope is *m*, which is the number multiplying *x* (also
called the coefficient of x). To find the slope of the line given, we
have to transform it into this form, so that y is by itself on one side
of the equation.

4x + 3y = 7

The goal is to get y alone, so first subtract 4x from both sides, to get
3y = *â€“* 4x + 7. Then divide both sides by 3:

$$\frac{3y}{3} = \ \frac{- 4x + 7}{3}$$

Which can be simplified to

$$y = \  - \frac{4}{3}x + \ \frac{7}{3}\ $$

The slope is the coefficient of x (the number multiplying x), which is
$- \frac{4}{3}$.
