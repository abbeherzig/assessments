There are several ways to write the equation of a line.
To find the slope of the line, it is easiest to re-write the equation
from this *standard form* to *slope-intercept form* instead.
Slope-intercept form is an equivalent equation that has y by itself on
one side of the equation, as you can see here:

$$4x + 5y = 10$$

We are trying to get y by itself, so we can subtract 4x from both sides,
to get

$$5y = - 4x + 10$$

Then divide both sides by 5, and the result is

$$y = \  - \frac{4}{5}x + 2$$

This form of the equation is written in *slope-intercept form*, which
allows us to read the slope directly from the coefficient of the x
(thatâ€™s the number that multiplies the x). From this form of the
equation, we can see that the slope is $- \frac{4}{5}$.
