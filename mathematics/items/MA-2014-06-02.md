This expression has addition and subtraction of signed (positive and negative) numbers, along with absolute value. The expression is

$$- 5 + \ \left| 9 - 11 \right|$$

9 – 11 = -2, so this expression becomes

$$- 5 + \ \left| - 2 \right|$$

|-2| is read as “the *absolute value* of negative two”, and it refers to the *size* of -2, without regard for its sign. The absolute value of -2 is 2, so the expression becomes

$$- 5 + \ 2$$

Which is equal to -3.
