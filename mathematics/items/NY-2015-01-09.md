The 2-ft by 3-ft bulletin board has 6 square feet. If the
student spent 15 minutes painting the 6 square feet, then we can find
the time it takes to paint one square foot as

$$\frac{15\ min}{6\ sq\ ft} = \ \frac{15}{6}\ \frac{\min}{\text{sq ft}} = 2.5\ \frac{\min}{\text{sq ft}}$$

So it takes 2.5 minutes to paint one square foot.
