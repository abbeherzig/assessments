The volume of a cone is
calculated from the coneâ€™s radius *r* and height *h* using this formula:

$$V = \ \frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h$$

In the diagram, h=4 cm. We are given the diameter, which is 6 cm. The
radius of a circle is half its diameter, so r = 3 cm. We can substitute
these into the volume formula, along with the value $\pi = 3.14$.

$$V = \ \frac{1}{3}(3.14)\left( 3 \right)^{2}(4)$$

Exponents are always evaluated first, so this becomes

$$V = \ \frac{1}{3}\left( 3.14 \right)\left( 9 \right)\left( 4 \right) = 37.68\ \text{cm}^{3}$$

This rounds to $V \approx 38\text{cm}^{3}$which is choice B.
