If a function is multiplied by a number larger than 1,
then it will get taller. In this example, multiplying the x^2^ by 4 will
make the graph 4 times as tall. You can also think of it as being
stretched vertically. This stretching makes the parabola appear
narrower.

Multiplying by a number between 0- and 1 would make it shorter, or would
shrink it vertically. That would make it appear wider.
