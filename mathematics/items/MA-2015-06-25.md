The volume of a cylinder is
calculated as

$$V = A \times h$$

$$A = \ \pi r^{2}$$

If we put that together, the volume of a cylinder is:

$$V = \ \pi r^{2}h$$

In the diagram, h=40 ft, and r = 15 ft. Substitute these into the volume
formula,

$$V = \ \pi\left( 15 \right)^{2}(40)$$

Exponents are always evaluated first, so this becomes

$$V = \ \pi(225)(40)$$

So

$V = \ 9000\pi$ cubic feet

Notice that since all the solutions include π, we do not need to use the
value of π = 3.14 in the calculation of the volume.
