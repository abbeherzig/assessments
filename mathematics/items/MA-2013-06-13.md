We are being asked to estimate the cost of the bags of
grass seed Mr. Thurman will need for his lawn. Since his lawn is
rectangular, we can estimate its dimensions as approximately 100 feet
wide and 150 feet long. An estimate of the area of the lawn is

$$A = l \times w \approx 100\ ft.\  \times 150\ ft. = 15,000\ sq.ft.$$

(The symbol $\approx$ means “approximately equal to.”) Since each bag of
grass seed covers about 5000 sq. ft of lawn, Mr. Thurman will need 3
bags of seed. A bag of seed costs approximately \$50, so the total cost
of the seed can be estimated as
$3\ bags\  \times \frac{\$ 50}{\text{bag}} = \$ 150$.
