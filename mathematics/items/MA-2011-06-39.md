This problem asks us to translate Ken and
Jeromeâ€™s purchases into a system of mathematical equations. We are told
that each video game costs *v* dollars and each DVD costs *d* dollars.
Ken bought two video games, which cost him *2v* dollars, and 1 DVD,
which cost him *d* dollars. If he spent \$105 in total, that can be
represented by the equation

$$2v + d = 105$$

Jerome bought one video game, which cost *d* dollars, and 4 DVDs, which
cost *4d* dollars. In total, he spent \$105, which can be written

$$v + 4d = 105$$

These two linear equations are represented in choice C.
