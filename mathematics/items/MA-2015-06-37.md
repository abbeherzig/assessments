The area of this trapezoid is 60 square cm. Remember
that the area of a trapezoid can be found from the formula

$$A = \ \frac{1}{2}\left( b_{1} + b_{2} \right)h$$

*h* stands for the height of the trapezoid, which the diagram shows is 6
cm.

\( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the two bases of the trapezoid. The base on top is 6
cm long, and the base on the bottom is the one we have to find. We can
substitute all the information we have into the formula to get

$$60 = \ \frac{1}{2}\left( 6 + x \right)6$$

Now we have an equation with one unknown, the variable x, so we can
solve for x. Our objective is to get x by itself on one side of the
equation. (We can do this in several ways—the way outlined here is just
one possible way to do this.)

The right side of the equation has three quantities multiplied together.
We know from the commutative property of multiplication that we can
multiply numbers in any order, so let's start by multiplying the ½ by
the 6, and we are left with

$$60 = \ 3\left( 6 + x \right)$$

Then divide both sides by 3:

$$20 = \ 6 + x$$

Subtract 6 from both sides, and we find that x = 14.
