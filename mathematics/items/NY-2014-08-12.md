A *correlation* measures how strongly associated two
variables are. If x and y are strongly correlated, then on a graph, the
points will fall close to a straight lie. A positive correlation means
that larger values of x tend to be associated with larger values of y. A
negative correlation means that larger values of x will be associated
with smaller values of y. No correlation (or zero correlation) means
that there is no linear pattern between the variables. A positive
correlation is described in choice 4.

Choice 1 describes a horizontal line, which represents no relationship
between the two variables.

Choice 2 describes a zero correlation.

Choice 3 describes a negative correlation.
