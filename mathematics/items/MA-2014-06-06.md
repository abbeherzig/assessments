The line graph (also called a dot plot) shows an X for
each person surveyed. Each X is placed over the number of television
sets that individual person reported. According to the graph, there
were:

3 people who reported 0 televisions

4 people who reported 1 television (4 televisions in all)

0 people reported 2 televisions,

2 people reported 3 televisions (6 televisions in all)

5 people reported 4 televisions (20 televisions in all)

6 people reported 5 televisions (30 televisions in all)

The mean, or average, number of televisions per person is the total
number of televisions divided by the number of people. In total, there
were 60 televisions reported by 20 people. That is a mean of 60/20 = 3
televisions per person.
