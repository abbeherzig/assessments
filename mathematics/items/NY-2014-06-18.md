This problem describes two expressions that are equal to each other,
both based on a number represented by the variable *x*. Let’s look at
each expression separately.

The first expression is “Three times the sum of a number and four.” The
sum of the number and 4 is (x+4). Three times that sum is written as
3(x+4).

The second expression is “five times the number, decreased by two.” Five
times the number can be written as 5x, making the entire expression
5x-2.

The problem says these two expressions are equal, leading to the
equation

$$3\left( x + 4 \right) = 5x - 2$$

This is choice 1.
