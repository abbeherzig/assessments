This question is asking you to *factor* a *binomial*
expression that is the *difference between two squares*. This factoring
problem uses this algebraic relationship for factoring the difference of
two squares:

$$a^{2} - \ b^{2} = (a - b)(a + b)$$

In order to use this equation, you have figure out what to call a and
what to call b. Notice that 81 = 9^2^ and 16x^2^ = (4x)^s^. so if we
want to use this equation, we can use a = 9 and b = 4x, and write the
expression you are given as the difference of two squares:

9^2^ - (4x)^2^ = (9 â€“ 4x)(9 + 4x).

To check that this is correct, you can use FOIL to multiply the factored
form on the right side of this equation, and verify that you get 81 -
16x^2^

*Definition*:

A binomial expression is a polynomial with only two terms. You can read
