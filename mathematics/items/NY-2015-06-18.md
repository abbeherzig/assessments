Let’s represent the number by ***n***. We can translate
each step of the question into mathematical notation like this:

“The square of a positive number” is written as *n^2^*

“24 more than 5 times the number” is written as *24+5n*

“is” means the two expressions are equal, so the problem translates into
this equation:

$$n^{2} = 24 + 5n$$

This is a quadratic equation, because it includes a term with n^2^. To
find n, we first have to use some algebra to get all terms on the left
side of the equation. If we subtract 5n and subtract 24 from both sides
of the equation, the result is

$$n^{2} - 5n - 24 = 0$$

There are two ways to solve this. We could use the quadratic equation,
but let’s factor it instead, which gives us

$$\left( n - 8 \right)(n + 3) = 0$$

(You should check that you agree with this factorization, by using FOIL
to multiply out all the terms). The only way to multiply two quantities
and get a product of 0 is if one of them must be 0. So either (n-8)=0,
or (n+3)=0. That leads to two possible values: n=8 or n= -3. Note that
the question asked for a positive number, so the solution is n=8.
