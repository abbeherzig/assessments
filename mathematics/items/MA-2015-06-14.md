There are several ways to multiply (x+3) by (x+4). The
most common way is to remember the acronym FOIL, which stands for First,
Outer, Inner, Last. It is a shortcut used to multiply to binomials like
this.

First: x路x = x^2^

Outer: x路4 = 4x

Inner: 3路x = 3x

Last: 3路4 = 12

Putting all that together, we get (x+3)(x+4) = x^2^ + 4x + 3x + 12 =
x^2^ + 7x +12, which is choice D.
