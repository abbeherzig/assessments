Remember that a cube is a 3-dimensional shape, like a
box, with all edges of equal length. Its volume is calculated using the
formula $V = \ s^{3}$. We can calculate the volume of the cube described
in each answer choice, and see which is closest to 231 cubic inches.

Choice A:
$V = {(16\ inches)}^{3} = 16\ inches\  \times 16\ inches\ \  \times 16\ inches = \ 4096\ cubic\ inches$

Choice B: $V = {(15\ inches)}^{3} = 3375\ cubic\ inches$

Choice C: $V = {(7\ inches)}^{3} = 343\ cubic\ inches$

Choice D: $V = {(6\ inches)}^{3} = 216\ cubic\ inches$

Choice D, 216 cubic inches, is closest to 231 cubic inches, so the
length of the edge of the cube is closest to 6 inches.

A possible shortcut: If you calculated $16^{3}$cubic inches for answer
choice A, you might have noticed that the volume 4096 cubic inches is so
much larger than the 231 cubic inches we are looking for, that we know
that 15 inches is also much too large, and you can skip to one of the
smaller numbers.
