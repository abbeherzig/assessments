Let's call the height of the building *h*. From the
diagram, you can see that the building and the ground form a right
angle, and that the building is the side of the right triangle opposite
the 40° angle. We can then calculate

$$\tan\left( 40 \right) = \ \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

$$\tan\left( 40 \right) = \ \frac{h}{72}$$

With your calculator, you can find tan(40°) = 0.839. So

$$0.839 = \ \frac{h}{72}$$

Mulitply both sides by 72 to find that h=60 feet (rounded to the nearest
foot).

  $$\sin{x =}\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

  $$\cos{x =}\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

  $$\tan{x =}\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$
