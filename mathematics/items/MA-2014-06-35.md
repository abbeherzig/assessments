The *y-intercept* of a line is the point where a graph
crosses the y-axis (the vertical axis). In a scatterplot like those
shown here, the *line of best fit* is the line that can be drawn through
the points that comes closest to the pattern of the points overall. If
the y-intercept of the line of best fit is negative, that means that the
points on the scatterplot have to cross the y-axis on the bottom half of
the graph, where the values of y are negative. This is the case only in
Graph D.
