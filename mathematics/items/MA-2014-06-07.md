The equation 3x(x-1)(x-2)=0 shows that the product of
three quantities is zero. That is, it says that if we multiply 3x,
(x-1), and (x-2), the product is zero. The *zero product property* is a
mathematical rule that says that if several quantities are multiplied,
the only way to get a product of zero is if one of them is zero.

In this problem, that means that at least one of the following must be
true:

3x = 0

X – 1 = 0

X – 2 = 0

Solving each of these for x, we find that the three possible values of x
are x=0, 1, or 2. Choice D is the only value that is not a solution to
the given equation.
