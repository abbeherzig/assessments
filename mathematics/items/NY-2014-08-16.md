This equation looks complicated because it includes
algebraic fractions. To make the equation simpler to work with, find a
common denominator for all the fractions. Since the denominators are 7x,
2x, and 14, a common denominator of 14x will work. We can then convert
each individual fraction to have that common denominator:

$$\frac{12}{7x} \times \frac{2}{2} = \ \frac{24}{14x}$$

$$\frac{3}{2x} \times \frac{7}{7} = \ \frac{21}{14x}$$

$$\frac{15}{14} \times \frac{x}{x} = \ \frac{15x}{14x}$$

The equation then becomes

$$\frac{24}{14x} + \ \frac{21}{14x} = \ \frac{15x}{14x}$$

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators on the
left side of the equation:

$$\frac{24 + 21}{14x} = \ \frac{15x}{14x}$$

Now we have two fractions equal to each other, and they have the same
denominator, so the numerators must be equal.

$$45 = 15x$$

Divide both sides by 15 to get 3 = x, which is choice 3.
