If the population increases by about the same amount
each year, the mathematical way to say that is the *rate of change is
approximately constant*. A quantity whose rate of change is constant
will form the graph of a line. If the population is increasing, then the
*slope* would be *positive*, and if it is decreasing, the slope would be
negative.

Choice A. The slope is zero if the population does not change at all on
average. The line is horizontal.

Choice B. A positive slope means the population is increasing. This is
the correct choice.

Choice C. A negative slope means the population is decreasing. The line
goes down as we move to the right.

Choice D. An undefined slope means that the line is vertical. If Ben
measured population over the past 10 years, we couldn't have a vertical
line, because we would have a population value for each of the past 10
years, which means the graph would move from left to right.
