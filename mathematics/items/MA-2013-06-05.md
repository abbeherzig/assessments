A *scatter plot* is a graph that shows values for
*bivariate* dataâ€”that is, data with two variables. In these graphs, the
two variables are called *x* and *y.* The line of best fit is a line
that is drawn through the points so that it comes closest to most of the
points. It is meant to summarize the data points as accurately as
possible. It usually lands right in the middle of the cloud of points.
The line in Graph A is above many of the points, so it is not close to
most of them. The lines in Graph B and Graph D do not even point in the
same direction as the points, so it is not close to most of the points.
The line in Graph C is right through the center of the cloud of points,
and represents the average of the data at each area of the graph, so C
is the correct choice.
