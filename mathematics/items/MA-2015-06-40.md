Imagine a pin placed at the point (0,0)—that point is
called the origin. Now spin the picture one-quarter turn to the
right—that is the 90° counter-clockwise rotation.

Choice A shows where the parallelogram will land after a 90° rotation,
so this is the correct choice.

Choice B shows where it will land after a 180° rotation. 180° is half of
a full turn.

No matter how you turn the parallelogram, you wouldn’t be able to get
the pictures shown in choices C and D. To get those, you need to flip
the parallelogram over, which is a transformation called a *reflection*.
