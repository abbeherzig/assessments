The surface area of a sphere is calculated using the
formula

$S.A. = 4\pi r^{2}$.

That formula requires us to know the radius of the sphere. The sphere we
are asked about has a diameter of 30 cm, so the radius is 15 cm
(remember that the radius is half the diameter). Using the surface area
formula, we can calculate

$$S.A. = 4\pi r^{2}$$

$$S.A. = 4 \bullet (3.14) \bullet 15^{2}$$

$$S.A. = 4 \bullet \left( 3.14 \right) \bullet 225 = 2826\ sq.\ cm.$$

This is closest to choice B.
