Each glass of orange juice contained 8 ounces, rounded
to the nearest ounce. That means that each glass has at least 7.5
ounces, but cannot have 8.5 ounces or more.

If all four glasses contained the minimum amount, then they would each
contain 7.5 ounces. All four glasses together would contain 4 x 7.5
ounces = 30 ounces total. Since there has to be at least 30 ounces of
juice all together, choices A and B are not possible.

If each glass had 8.5 ounces, then Ethan would have rounded the amount
of juice per glass to 9 ounces, so each glass has to hold less than 8.5
ounces. For four glasses combined, there has to be less than 4 x 8.5
ounces = 34 ounces. Since there has to be less than 34 ounces, the only
possible choice is choice C, 31.6 ounces.
