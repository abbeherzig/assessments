The card is 3 inches high and 4 inches wide, to the
nearest inch. Since both measurements are rounded to the nearest inch,
then the height of the card can be as short as 2.5 inches and must be
shorter than 3.5 inches. The width of the card can be as short as 3.5
inches, and must be shorter than 4.5 inches.

The smallest the area of the card can be is

$$A = l\  \times w = 2.5\ in\  \times 3.5\ in = 8.75\ sq.\ in$$

That eliminates choices A and B as possibilities.

The area of the card has to be less than

$$A = l\  \times w = 3.5\ in\  \times 4.5\ in = 15.75\ sq.\ in$$

So choice C, 15.5 square inches is possible, but 16 square inches
(choice D) is too large.

This inaccuracy in measurement is called *measurement error*. That does
not mean that the measurements are incorrect, but that they are measured
with some inaccuracy (in this case, only to the nearest inch). You can
