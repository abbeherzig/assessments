Greg's car loses \(4.5\% \) of its value each year. That means that after 1
year, its value is \( 95.5 \% \) of its value the year before. Greg purchased
his car for \( \$12,500 \).

After 1 year, Greg's car has a value of \( V = \$ 12,500\  \times 95.5\% \)
which is more typically written as of \( V = \$ 12,500\  \times 0.955 \).

After 2 years, Greg's car has depreciated by another \(4.5\% \), so its value
after 2 years is \( 95.5\% \) of its value at the end of the first year, or

$$V = (\$ 12,500\  \times 0.955)\  \times 0.955$$

which can also be written as

$$V = \$ 12,500\  \times {(0.955)}^{2}$$

After another year its value depreciates even further, so after 3 years
its value is

$$V = \$ 12,500\  \times {(0.955)}^{2} \times 0.955 = \$ 12,500\  \times {0.955}^{3}$$

Continuing this pattern, we can see that after *y* years, the value of
Greg's car would be

$$V = \$ 12,500\  \times {(0.955)}^{y}$$

So after 5 years, Greg's car has a value of

$$V = \$ 12,500\  \times {(0.955)}^{5}$$

Which is choice B.

You can see another example of this type of *depreciation*, also called
*exponential decay*, here:
