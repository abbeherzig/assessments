The *inverse property of multiplication* is an important
property of numbers. It says that every number, except for zero, has a
*multiplicative inverse*. That means that for every number *k* (except
0), there is another number *n*, so that when *k* is multiplied by *n*,
the product is 1. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 1/3 is 3,
because $\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1$. The multiplicative inverse of
$\frac{3}{4}$ is $\frac{4}{3}$ because
$\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{3} = 1$. It turns out that the
multiplicative inverse of every non-zero number is its *reciprocal*.

The multiplicative inverse is described in choice C.
