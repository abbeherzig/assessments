In this scatterplot, we can see that the amount of
commission a salesperson earns (shown on the y-axis) is higher if the
salesperson has higher monthly sales (shown on the x-axis). The pattern
of the data is somewhat linear, and you might imagine drawing a line
through the points to approximate the patterns in the data. This line is
called the *line of best fit*, or sometimes the *regression equation*.
The question asks about a sales person whose monthly sales are \$0.8
million. If you locate 0.8 on the x-axis, and then trace up to where
that best-fit line is, we find that the estimated commission (y-value)
is about \$4500, which is choice C.
