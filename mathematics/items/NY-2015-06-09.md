We are given four linear equations to choose from, and we
have to find the slope of each line to decide which one has the slope
we’re looking for. When the equation of a line is written in
*slope-intercept form,* like this:

$$y = mx + b$$

Then the slope of the line is *m*—the number that multiplies the x. In
order to get the slope of each line, we have to write the equation so
that y is on the left side by itself. If we do that for each of the 4
choices, we will find:

(1) $y = \ \frac{3}{2}x - 3$

(2) $y = \  - \frac{2}{3}x - 2$

(3) $y = \  - \frac{2}{3}x + 2$

(4) $y = \ \frac{2}{3}x + 2$

The fourth one is the only one with a slope of 2/3.
