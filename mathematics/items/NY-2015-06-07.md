This equation looks complicated because of all the
fractions. To make the equation simpler to work with, find a common
denominator for all the fractions. Since the denominators are 5, 3, and
x, a common denominator that will work is 15x. We can then convert each
individual fraction to have that common denominator:

$$\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{3x}{3x} = \ \frac{3x}{15x}$$

$$\frac{2}{x} \times \frac{15}{15} = \ \frac{30}{15x}$$

$$\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5x}{5x} = \ \frac{5x}{15x}$$

The equation then becomes

$$\frac{3x}{15x} + \ \frac{30}{15x} = \ \frac{5x}{15x}$$

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators on the
left side of the equation:

$$\frac{3x + 30}{15x} = \ \frac{5x}{15x}$$

Now we have two fractions equal to each other, and they have the same
denominator, so

$$3x + 30 = 5x$$

Subtract 3x from both sides to get 30 = 2x. Divide both sides by 2 to
get 15 = x, which is choice 4.
