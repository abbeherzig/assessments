We can translate this statement from words into
mathematical symbols step by step;

“The product of a number and 3” is written as *3n*

“The product of a number and 3, increased by 5” is written as *3n + 5*

Seven less than twice the number: *2n – 7*

“is” means the two expressions are equal, so put all this together to
get *3n + 5 = 2n – 7*
