Each X in this graph represents a single town. There are
10 towns in the graph, shown by ten X's. Each X appears over the area
(in square miles) of that town.

The median of a set of data is the middle value, when the data values
are listed in order (from largest to smallest, or from smallest to
largest). Because there is an even number of counties, the middle values
are the 5^th^ and 6^th^ values in the list. When there is an even number
of values, the median is the average of those two middle values. The
5^th^ value is 35 square miles, and the 6^th^ value is 45 square miles,
so their average is 40 square miles.
