To plot these *bivariate data* on a scatterplot, we have
to list each pair of values as an ordered pair—that is, in the form
(x,y). We can re-write the table as the series of (x,y) points:

(2,1)

(3,2)

(2,2)

(3,5)

(6.5)

(5,5)

(3,1)

(4,6)

(3,3)

(4,3)

Each graph shows **Number of People in Household** on the x-axis, and
**Number of Washes** on the y-axis. Now let’s look at the points on each
graph.

Graph A shows 3 different points with x=2, but the data only shows 2
points with x=2.

Graph B and Graph C both show 2 different points with x=2, but they are
(2,2) and (2,3), while in the data table, the points are (2,1) and
(2,2).

Graph D shows all the points shown in the data table.
