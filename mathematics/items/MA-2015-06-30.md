We can solve this problem using a table. Since the first
four hours cost \$30, renting the truck for 1 through 4 hours costs
\$30. The fifth hour costs an additional \$10, for a total of \$40. The
sixth hour costs \$10 more, so by then Brandon has spent \$50. We can
continue this pattern, as shown here:

  Number of hours    | Total cost
  -------------------| ------------
     1 hour          | \$30
     2 hours         | \$30
     3 hours         | \$30
     4 hours         | \$30
     5 hours         | \$40
     6 hours         | \$50
     7 hours         | \$60

We are asked to find the maximum number of hours for which Brandon can
rent the truck, if he cannot spend more than \$60. From our table, we
can see that Brandon can rent the truck for 7 hours.
