The *median* of a set of data is the middle value, when
the data are listed in order from smallest to largest or from largest to
smallest. If there is an even number of values, then there are two
middle values, and we average those two values to find the median. To
find the median, we first have to sort the data given into order, like
this:

  **Gold Medalist**  | **Distance (meters)**
  -------------------|-----------------------
  Ed Hamm            | 7.73
  Ed Gordon          | 7.64
  Albert Gutterson   | 7.60
  Frank Irons        | 7.48
  DeHart Hubbard     | 7.44
  William Petersson  | 7.15

Once the data are in order, we can find the middle value. Since there
are six values, the middle are the 3^rd^ and 4^th^ values, so the median
is the average of 7.60 and 7.48 meters which is 7.54 meters.

Remember that data have to be sorted in order before you can find the
median.
