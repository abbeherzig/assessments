According to Suzanna's table, she received 65 responses to her survey. The percent of students who gave each response are calculated in this table:

Student Response | Number of Students | Percent of Students
-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------
 Yes             | 23                 | \( \frac{23}{65} \times 100\% = 35.4\% \)
 No              | 12                 | \( \frac{12}{65} \times 100\% = 18.5\% \)
 Maybe           | 30                 | \( \frac{30}{65} \times 100\% = 46.2\% \)
 total           | 65                 |  

These percents come closest to the values shown in pie chart D.
