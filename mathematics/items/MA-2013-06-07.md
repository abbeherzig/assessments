You could calculate the value of the given expression and
each of the answer choices, to see which choice has the same value.
However, you can also recognize an application of the commutative
property of addition, which says that for any two numbers *a* and *b*,

$$a + b = b + a$$

In the case of the expression given to us in this problem, there are
three numbers, but if you consider *a* to be the enter expression in
parentheses, and b = 1.3, we can apply the commutative property like
this:

![](media/image1.png){width="2.6666666666666665in"
height="0.877419072615923in"}

Which is choice C.

The commutative property is one of several important properties of
numbers that are helpful in all kinds of calculations. You can read
