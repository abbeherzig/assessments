If a function is multiplied by a positive number, its
graph gets stretched vertically (up and down) by the size of that
number. In this case, the function y=x^2^ is being multiplied by two, so
its graph will be twice as high. That is shown in response 4.

Response 1 shows the graph multiplied by ½ (check what happens to x=1 in
the original function and see where it ends up on this graph). Response
2 shows the graph of the function multiplied by a negative number—that's
what flips it upside down. And choice 3 shows a graph that is
*translated* (moved over) by two units.
