A trapezoid is a special type of quadrilateral (a
four-sided shape) that has two parallel sides. In this trapezoid, the
top and bottom sides are parallel. These are called the bases of the
trapezoid, and their lengths are abbreviated as \( b_{1} \) and \( b_{2} \). The area
of a trapezoid is calculated using the formula

$$Area = \ \frac{1}{2}\left( b_{1} + b_{2} \right)h$$

Using the lengths shown in the diagram, the area of this trapezoid is

$$Area = \ \frac{1}{2}\left( 6.7 + 15.5 \right) \times 4.3 = \ \frac{1}{2} \times 22.2\  \times 4.3 = 47.73\ \text{in}^{2}$$

This is choice C.

One good way to remember the formula for the area of a trapezoid is to
focus on this part of the formula:
$\ \frac{1}{2}\left( b_{1} + b_{2} \right)$, which is the average length
of the two bases. So the area of a trapezoid can also be thought of as

$$Area = (average\ of\ bases) \times h$$
