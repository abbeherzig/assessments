We are given the equation $y = \ \frac{2}{5}x + 2$, and
asked to calculate the value of x when $y = 2\frac{2}{3}$.

To start, let's substitute that value for y into the equation, and we
get

$$2\frac{2}{3} = \ \frac{2}{5}x + 2$$

We need to get the x by itself, so first we need to subtract 2 from each
side.

$$2\frac{2}{3} - 2 = \ \frac{2}{5}x + 2 - 2$$

$$\frac{2}{3} = \ \frac{2}{5}x$$

Then, to get rid of the $\frac{2}{5}$ in front of the x, we can multiply
both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\frac{2}{5}$, like
this:

$$\frac{5}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} = \ \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{2}{5}x$$

Which leads to

$$\frac{5}{3} = \ x$$

The correct choice is choice C, since $1\frac{2}{3}$ is equivalent to
5/3.
