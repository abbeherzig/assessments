This step represents the distributive property. The
distributive property says that for any numbers a, b, and c,
$a\left( b + c \right) = )represents\ the\ distributive\ property.\ The\ distributive\ property\ says\ that\ pression.\ x = ction\ is\ narrower.\ \text{lve\ possible\ beef\ s}ab + ac$.
Robert applied that rule to
find$\ 3\left( x + 2 \right) = 3 \times x)represents\ the\ distributive\ property.\ The\ distributive\ property\ says\ that\ pression.\ x = ction\ is\ narrower.\ \text{lve\ possible\ beef\ s} + 3 \times 2 = 3x + 6$

The properties of numbers are important for understanding and working
with algebraic expressions and other quantities. For example, when you
factor an algebraic expression, you are usually using a combination of
these properties. You can review them here:
