This expression asks us to use the *distributive
property*, which says that for any numbers,
$a \bullet \left( b + c \right) = a \bullet b + a \bullet c$. In this
expression, that means

$$- 2 \bullet \left( x - 5 \right) = - 2 \bullet x + ( - 2)( - 5)$$

The right side of the equation can be further simplified to -2x + 10,
Choice D.

The complete name of the distributive property is the *distributive
property of multiplication over addition*. This is an important
distinction, because the distributive property does not necessarily work
for any operation outside parenthesesâ€”this is specific for
multiplication. You can read more about the commutative, associative,
and distributive properties here:
