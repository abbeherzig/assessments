Let's evaluate each expression.

*Choice A*. (6-2) - |2-6|

> We have to start by evaluating what is inside the parentheses and
> inside the absolute value symbols (the vertical bars around the 2-6).
>
> (6-2) - |2-6| = 4 - |-4|
>
> |-4| is read as “the *absolute value* of negative four”, and it refers
> to the *size* of -4, without regard for its sign. The absolute value
> of -4 is 4, so the expression becomes
>
> 4 – 4
>
> Which is equal to zero.

Choice B.

> Just as in the previous expression, we have to start by evaluating the
> expressions inside parentheses and absolute value.
>
> (2 – 6) – |6 – 2| = -4 - |4| =-4 – 4 = -8, so this expression does
> *not* equal zero.

Choice C:

> |6 – 2| - |2 – 6| = |4| - |-4| = 4 – 4 = 0

Choice D:

> |2 – 6| - |6 – 2| = |-4| - |4| = 4 – 4 = 0

The correct choice is B.
