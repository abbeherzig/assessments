We start with triangle PQR, and translate it up by 4
units, and then reflect it over the y-axis. All four answer choices
start with ΔPQR in the same position. *Translating ΔPQR up* moves the
entire triangle up by 4 units. Reflecting it over the y-axis would flip
it left-to-right over the y-axis, as if the y-axis was a mirror.

Choice A shows the result of translating ΔPQR up 4 units and then
reflecting it over the x-axis.

Choice B shows the result of translating ΔPQR up 4 units and then
reflecting it over the y-axis, so this is the correct choice.

Choice C shows the result of translating ΔPQR *down* 4 units and then
reflecting it over the y-axis.

Choice D shows the result of translating ΔPQR 4 units to the right, and
then reflecting it over the x-axis (flipping it upside down).

Translation and reflection are two examples of *transformations* of
geometric shapes. You can review more about transformations here:

the bottom of the page can show you specific details of translations and
reflections.
