Notice that we are being asked to subtract the first
polynomial *from* the second. One way to write this is:

$$- 3x^{2} + 6x + 7 - \left( 6x^{2} - 13x + 12 \right)\ $$

We then need to use the distributive property to distribute the negative
sign over all the terms in parentheses, which changes the sign of each
term (from positive to negative or from negative to positive).

$$\  - 3x^{2} + 6x + 7 - 6x^{2} + 13x - 12\ $$

Then combine like terms:

$$\left( - 3x^{2} - 6x^{2} \right) + \left( 6x + 13x \right) + (7 - 12)\ $$

$$- 9x^{2} + 19x - 5\ $$

Sometimes it is easier to do this by lining up the polynomials
vertically. You can see examples of this, and review more about adding
and subtracting polynomials, here:
