The line of best fit to a scatter plot of data points
is the line that comes closest to most of the points. It usually lands
right in the middle of the cloud of points. The line in Graph A is below
most of the points, so it is not close to most of them. The lines in
Graph B and Graph C do not even move in the same direction as the
points, so it is not close to most of the points. The line in Graph D is
right through the center of the cloud of points, and is as close as
possible to most of the points, so it is the correct choice.
