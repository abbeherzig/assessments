inding the *sum* means to add. Remember that if two
fractions have the same denominator, they can be added by adding the
numerators, and keeping the denominators the same. We can write

$$\frac{3x - 4}{x + 3} + \frac{2x - 5}{x + 3} = \ \frac{(3x - 4) + (2x - 5)}{x + 3}$$

Combining like terms in the numerator leads to

$$\frac{5x - 9}{x + 3}$$

Which is choice 1.
