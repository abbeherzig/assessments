f(x) = 0 says that the graph of the function f(x) crosses the x-axis,
which is where y = 0. Looking at the graph, we see that the function
crosses the x-axis when x = -1 and when x = 5. This is choice 2.

You can see a further explanation of functions and their roots (also
called *zeros of the function*) here:
