he two perfect squares that are closest to 152 are 144
and 169. That is,

$$144 < 152 < 169$$

So it follows that

$$\sqrt{144} < \sqrt{152} < \sqrt{169}$$

Which is equivalent to

$$12 < \sqrt{152} < 13$$

That means that $\sqrt{152}$ is either point *J* or point *K*. Since 152
is much closer to 144 than it is to 169, $\sqrt{152}$ is closer to 12
than 13, so it must be near point *J*, which is choice A*.*
