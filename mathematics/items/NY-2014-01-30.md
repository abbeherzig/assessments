Julie's children's ages are consecutive odd integers. Each consecutive
odd integer is 2 more than the one before (for example, 1, 3, 5 or 7, 9,
11). Julie's youngest child's age is $$x$$, which means the ages of her
other two children are $$x + 2$$ and $$x + 4$$. The sum of their ages is

$$x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 3x + 6$$

This is choice D.

Solving problems often requires observing patterns, often using
variables, examples, or tables and graphs. You can see examples of these
