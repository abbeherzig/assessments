The volume of a rectangular tank is calculated as

$$V = length \times width \times height$$

The key to finding the volume of water in the tank is to recognize that
we want the volume of the water, not the total volume of the tank. The
height of the tank really doesn't matter. Since the the water is 2 Â½
feet deep, the volume is

$$V = 5\ ft \times 4\ ft \times 2.5\ ft$$

$$V = 50\ \text{ft}^{3}$$
