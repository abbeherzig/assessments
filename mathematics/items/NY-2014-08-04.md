This question is asking you to *factor* a particular
*binomial* expression: the *difference between two squares*. This
factoring problem uses this algebraic relationship for factoring the
difference of two squares:

$$a^{2} - \ b^{2} = (a - b)(a + b)$$

You are given the expression 9x^2^ â€“ 100. Notice that both terms in this
expression can be written as a square: 9x^2^ = (3x)^2^ and 100 = 10^2^.
We can then use the relationship above to write

$${(3x)}^{2} - \ 10^{2} = (3x - 10)(3x + 10)$$

Comparing that the expression in the problem, you can see that b=10.

To check that this is correct, you can use FOIL to multiply the factored
form on the right side of this equation (remember FOIL?) and verify that
you get $9x^2 - 100$.
