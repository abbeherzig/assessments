We have to figure out two things: (1) the equation of the
line in the graph, and (2) which inequality symbol represents the shaded
area.

The equation of a line can be written as y = mx + b, where m and be are
replaced by numbers representing the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).
The line on the graph crosses the y-axis at y=â€”4, so that is the
y-intercept. To find the slope, pick any two points on the line and find
the difference between their y-values and the difference between their
x-values. You will find that

$$slope = \ \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \ \frac{4}{3}$$

A line with slope = 4/3 and y-intercept -4 is written as

$$y = \ \frac{4}{3}x - 4$$

Now that we have the equation of the line, we have to figure out which
inequality symbol represents what is shown in the graph.

Since the shaded part is below the line, the region shows y values that
are less than or equal to the values on the line. That observation leads
to writing

$$y\  \leq \ \frac{4}{3}x - 4$$
