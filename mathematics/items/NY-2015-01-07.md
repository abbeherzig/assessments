Let’s use b to stand for the number of miles Jose will
ride his bike on Sunday. Since he rode m miles on Saturday and b miles
on Sunday, he rode m+b miles combined. He rode 50 miles total, so, we
can write m + b = 50. To find b, the number of miles he rode on Sunday,
subtract m from both sides, to find b = 50 – m.
