In the graph, each X shows one vehicle. For example, the
very first X on the left shows that one car has 27 mpg. There are no Xs
at 28, so no cars had 28 mpg, and 2 cars had 29 mpg. This type of graph
is often called a *dot plot*, using dots in place of the X's.

The median of all the data values is the middle value, when the numbers
are listed in order from smallest to largest. Fortunately, the line
chart shows the values in order for us. To find the middle one, we count
the X's to find there are 15 cars shown in the plot.

With 15 cars, the median is the 8^th^ one in the listâ€”the value that has
7 values above and 7 values below. That 8^th^ value is 33 mpg.
