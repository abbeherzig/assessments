From this survey of 100 voters, the table shows that 14
of them will vote for Lyshon. We can estimate the probability that a
randomly chosen student will vote for Lyshon as:

$$\text{Prob}\left( \text{Vote\ for\ Lyshon} \right) = \ \frac{\text{Number\ voting\ for\ Lyshon}}{\text{Total\ number\ of\ voters}} = \ \frac{14}{100} = \ \frac{7}{50}$$
