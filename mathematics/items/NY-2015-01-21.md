It does not make sense to divide by zero, so an algebraic expression is
*undefined* (that is, does not make sense) if the denominator is zero.
In this expression, the denominator is zero when

$$2x - 1 = 0$$

Add one to both sides and then divide by 2, to find x = 1/2. You can
test this by substituting it into the original expression. X=1/2 gives
you zero in the denominator, so the expression is undefined.
