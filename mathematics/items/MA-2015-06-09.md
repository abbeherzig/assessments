We are being asked to estimate the value of
$\frac{2450}{19,544}$ as a simple fraction. Notice that 2,450 is close
to 2,500, and 19,544 is close to 20,000. We can approximate
$\frac{2450}{19,544}$ as$\ \frac{2500}{20,000}$ . Then we can reduce
this fraction as:

$$\frac{2,500}{20,000} = \ \frac{25}{200} = \ \frac{1}{8}$$

The best estimate of the fraction of people who received a free hat is
1/8.
