Jaya is buying a new car, and we are asked to *estimate*
the sales tax she has to pay on her car. The car costs \$28,495, and the
tax rate is 6.25%. We can estimate the cost of the car as approximately
\$30,000, and the tax rate as 6%. The approximate amount of tax is

6% of \$30,000 = 0.06 Â· \$30,000 = \$1,800.

This is Choice C.
