It does not make sense to divide by zero, so an algebraic expression is
*undefined* (that is, does not make sense) if the denominator is zero.
In this expression, the denominator is zero when

$$3x - 6 = 0$$

Add six to both sides and then divide by 3, to find x = 2. You can test
this by substituting it into the original expression. X=2 makes the
denominator of that expression zero, so it is undefined.
