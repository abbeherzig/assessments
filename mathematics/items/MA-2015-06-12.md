For any number n (other than zero),
$n \bullet \frac{1}{n} = 1$. 1/12 is called the *reciprocal* or the
*multiplicative inverse* of 12, and 12 is the reciprocal of 1/12. This
is a basic property of numbers. Every number other than zero has a
multiplicative inverse, and the product of a number and its
multiplicative inverse is 1.
