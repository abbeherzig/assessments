This expression looks complicated because of all the
fractions. (*Remember it is not an equation, because there is no equal
sign. It is an expression, because it just expresses a quantity.)* To
make the expression simpler to work with, find a common denominator for
all the fractions. Since the denominators are 7x and 5x, a common
denominator that will work is 35x. We can then convert each individual
fraction to have that common denominator:

$$\frac{10}{7x} \times \frac{5}{5} = \ \frac{50}{35x}$$

$$\frac{3}{5x} \times \frac{7}{7} = \ \frac{21}{35x}$$

The expression then becomes

$$\frac{50}{35x} - \ \frac{21}{35x}$$

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:

$$\frac{51 - 21}{35x} = \ \frac{29}{35x}$$
