The median is the middle value, when data are listed in
order of size (smallest to largest, or largest to smallest). The table
shows the price range for 21 televisions, so the median is the 11^th^
value in the list (10 prices would be higher and 10 prices would be
lower). We donâ€™t know the exact prices, but we can see that the 11^th^
price is in the range \$150 through \$199. Only choice B falls in this
range.

The way this set of data was presented in this problem is called grouped
frequencies, because it shows the frequency of data values in a set of
groups. You can read more about estimating the mean, median, and mode
with grouped frequency data here:
