Because *ΔRST* is the transformation of *ΔLMN,* the two
triangles are congruent. In congruent triangles, the lengths of
corresponding sides are equal and the measures of corresponding angles
are equal.

We are asked to find the length of the segment
$\overset{\overline{}}{\text{RT}}$ , but it is hard to find the precise
coordinates of points *R* and *T* from the graph. Fortunately, the
coordinates of all the points in *ΔLMN* are easier to read. We just have
to figure out which side of *ΔLMN* is congruent to side
$\overset{\overline{}}{\text{RT}}$ from the other triangle. In *ΔRST* ,
$\overset{\overline{}}{\text{RT}}$ is not the shortest side and it is
not the longest side. In *ΔLMN,* that corresponds to side
$\overset{\overline{}}{\text{LN}}$, so we know that
$\overset{\overline{}}{\text{RT}} \cong \overset{\overline{}}{\text{LN}}$.

From the graph, we can see that $\overset{\overline{}}{\text{LN}}$
extends from (1,-1) to (1, -5), so it is 4 units long (you can see this
by counting the boxes between *L* and *N*). Since
$\overset{\overline{}}{\text{RT}} \cong \overset{\overline{}}{\text{LN}}$,
$\overset{\overline{}}{\text{RT}}$ is 4 units long as well.
