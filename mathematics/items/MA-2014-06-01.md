This problem asks us to estimate the total weight of the
pumpkins. Since the average weight of a pumpkin is more than 10 pounds,
the total weight of 364 pumpkins has to be more than 3640 pounds. Since
the average weight of each individual pumpkin is close to 11 pounds, the
total weight would be just less than 364 pumpkins x 11 pounds/pumpkin =
4004 pounds total.
