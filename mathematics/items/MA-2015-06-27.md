The *line of best fit* in a scatterplot is the line that
comes closest to most of the points in the graph. In graph A, the slope
of that line is negative. In graph B, the slope is approximately zero.
In Graph C, the slope is positive, and if you look at the overall
(change in y)/(change in x), the value of that slope is about 5, so this
is the correct choice. Graph D shows a vertical line, which has an
undefined slope.
