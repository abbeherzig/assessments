This problem describes the Total Cost of a software
package as a function of the number of computers it is installed on.
Let's explore this function using a table. We are told that the Total
Cost is \$500 for the first 10 computers. We can install the software on
any number of computers up to 10, and the Total Cost will still be
\$500. That is shown in the table.

  Number of computers   Total Cost
  --------------------- ------------
  1                     \$500
  2                     \$500
  3                     \$500
  4                     \$500
  5                     \$500
  6                     \$500
  7                     \$500
  8                     \$500
  9                     \$500
  10                    \$500
  11                    
  12                    
  13                    

Notice that up through 10 computers, the cost function is *constant;* it
does not change. Once we get more than 10 computers, we have to add \$20
for each additional computer. Let's add that to the table for a few more
computers.

  Number of computers   Total Cost
  --------------------- ------------
  1                     \$500
  2                     \$500
  3                     \$500
  4                     \$500
  5                     \$500
  6                     \$500
  7                     \$500
  8                     \$500
  9                     \$500
  10                    \$500
  11                    **\$520**
  12                    **\$540**
  13                    **\$560**

Once we get past 10 computers, the cost function changes linearly, since
each additional computer adds the same amount to the total cost. The
Total Cost function could be graphed like this:

height="2.3925437445319333in"}

This function is a constant linear function for the first 10 computers,
and linearly increasing for all computers above 10 (choice C).
