he distributive property allows us to distribute something being
multiplied across two terms being added. It us usally written as

$$a\left( b + c \right) = ab + ac$$

The equation shown is set up to use a=(x-6), b=8, and c=x.

These properties of numbers are a very important foundation to all of
algebra. You can review them here:
