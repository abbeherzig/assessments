This problem asks us to estimate a square root. First we
have to evaluate what we are estimating the square root of, so we can
calculate

$$\sqrt{10^{2} - 5^{2}} = \sqrt{100 - 25} = \sqrt{75}$$

Remember that since the expression 10^2^ â€“ 5^2^ all appears under the
same square root sign, we have to evaluate that entire expression first,
before finding the square root. The closest perfect square to 75 is 81,
so $\sqrt{75}$ is a little less than$\sqrt{81}$ , which is 9.
