To re-write the given expression, we can re-arrange the
order of the terms, sometimes called *combining like terms*,. To be
careful, our first step will be to re-write the -4y term and the -2y
term using addition instead of subtraction, like this:

$$\left( 6x + - 4y + 9 \right) + \left( - 3x + - 2y \right)$$

Once this is all written as addition, we can take advantage of both the
*commutative property of addition* (numbers can be added in any order)
and the *associative property of addition* (numbers can be grouped in
any order when they are added).

$$\left( 6x + - 4y + 9 \right) + \left( - 3x + - 2y \right)$$

$$= \left( 6x - 3x \right) + \left( - 4y + \  - 2y \right) + 9$$

$$= 3x - 6y + 9\ $$

Which is choice B.
