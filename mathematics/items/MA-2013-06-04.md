This problem asks us to simplify an inequality, by doing
various algebraic manipulations to get the x by itself. This is similar
to solving an equation, but there are a few special rules we have to be
careful about. We are starting with

$$0.5x - 18\  \geq - 14$$

To get x by itself, first add 18 to both sides of the inequality:

$$0.5x - 18 + 18 \geq - 14 + 18$$

$$0.5x\  \geq 4$$

Then divide both sides by 0.5. (A mental math trick to use here:
dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2.)

$$\frac{0.5x}{0.5} \geq \frac{4}{0.5}$$

$$x \geq 8$$

You can check this answer by substituting each of the answer choices
into the original inequality. You will find that the inequality is not
true for x=2, and that it is true for the other 3 choices. But the
question asks which is the smallest number that makes the inequality
true, so 8 is the correct response.
