Two variables are *inversely proportional* if
one increases at the same rate as the other decreases; for example, if
the value of one variable becomes 10 times larger, the other variable
becomes one tenth as large. This is often represented mathematically as

$$y\  \propto \frac{1}{x}$$

As a formula, this is written \( y = \frac{k}{x} \) or *xy = k*, where *k*
is called the *constant of proportionality*.

In our case, the number of mail carriers is inversely proportional to
the time it takes to deliver the mail. That means that twice as many
mail carriers would take half as long to deliver the mail, and half the
number of mail carriers would take twice as long. If it takes 8 mail
carriers 6 hours, using 4 mail carriers is half as many, so it would
take them twice as long, or 12 hours.

This is choice D.
