We need to find the mean, the median, and the mode.

The *mode* is the value that occurs most frequenly in the data. The most
common score is 92 (5 students got that score), so mode=92.

The *median* is the value that occurs in the middle, if all the scores
are listed in order from largest to smallest. Adding the frequencies
shows that there are 17 scores total. The median is the 9^th^ one in the
list, which will have 8 scores above it and 8 scores below it. The
median = 88.

The *mean* is the traditional average, calculated by adding up all the
scores and dividing by the number of scores. Be careful reading the
table! We are ***not*** calculating the mean of 96, 92, 88, 84, 78, and
60. Instead we have to calculate the mean of two 96s, five 92s, three
88s, two 84s, four 78s, and one 60. The mean = 1456/17 = 85.6.

The mode is largest, followed by the median, and then the mean, which is
choice 3.
