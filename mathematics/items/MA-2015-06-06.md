This equation says that two quantities are multiplied
together and the product is zero. The only way the product of two
quantities can be zero is if one (or both) of the quantities is equal to
zero. This is sometimes called the *zero product property*.

If (x-2)(x+9)=0, then either x – 2 = 0 or x+9=0.

X – 2 = 0 means x=2

X+9 = 0 means x = -9
