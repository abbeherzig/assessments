To express x as a function of y and z, we first need to make sure all
the terms with an x are on one side of the equation, and all the terms
without an x are on the other side. The equation given is already
arranged that way, with all the terms with x on the right side of the
equal sign.

The x can be isolated from the other variables by factoring the right
side of the equation, like this:

$$x + xy^{2} = x\left( 1 + y^{2} \right)\ (this\ uses\ the\ distibutive\ property)$$

The overall equation becomes

$$y + z = x\left( 1 + y^{2} \right)\ $$

To get the x by itself, divide both sides by (1+y^2^)

$$\frac{z + y}{1 + y^{2}} = x$$
