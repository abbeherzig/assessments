The word HEXAGON has seven letters. If we were to mix
them up into another order, there are 7 letters we can choose first, but
on the second choice there will only be 6 left to choose from, and on
the following choice there are only 5 letters left. Continuing through
all the letters, there are

$$7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 540\ $$

Different ways to arrange the letters. The quantity
$7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$ is called “7
factorial” and is abbreviated in mathematics as 7!.
