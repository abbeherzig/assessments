This problem is asking us to translate the words in the problem into
algebraic notation. Two variables are defined: *L* is the length of a
rectangle, and *w* is its width. We are told that they have this
relationship:

The width is 4 less than half the length. 
Half the length is written as \( \frac{1}{2}L \). 
Four less than that is \( \frac{1}{2}L - 4 \). 
This leads to the equation \( w = \ \frac{1}{2}L - 4 \), which is choice C.
