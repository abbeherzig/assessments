This problem is asking us to translate the words in the problem into
algebraic notation. Two variables are defined: *l* is the length of a
rectangle, and *w* is its width. We are told that they have this
relationship:

The width is 4 less than half the length. Half the length is written as
\( \frac{1}{2}l \). Four less than that is \( \frac{1}{2}l - 4 \). This leads to
the equation \( w = \ \frac{1}{2}l - 4 \), which is choice 3.
