his question asks us to recommend a probability for
getting a blue face on top. We don't know much about the cube, but we
have some data.

Student 1 got 40% blue (12/30), student 2 got 40% blue (20/50), and
student 3 got 40% as well (8/20). Based on this, we would estimate that
someone else who rolled the cube a number of times would get
approximately 40% of their rolls showing a blue face on top. Student 4
rolled the cube 75 times, and 40% of 75 is

$$40\%\  \times 75 = 0.40 \times 75 = 30$$

Our best estimate is that the fourth student will have a blue face on
top 30 times.
