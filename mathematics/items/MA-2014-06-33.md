A rectangle with a length of 15 cm and a width of 8 cm
has an area of $A = l \times w = 15\ x\ 8 = 120\ square\ centimeters.\ $
We are told that we have a circle with the same area. Remember that the
area of a circle is calculated using the formula

$$A = \ \pi r^{2}$$

We know that the area of this circle is 120, and we can use the
approximate value $\pi = 3.14$. Substituting these values into the
formula, we get

$$120 = (3.14)r^{2}$$

We are asked to find an approximate value for *r*, the radius. First,
divide both sides by 3.14:

$$\frac{120}{3.14} = r^{2}$$

$$38.2 = r^{2}$$

Now to find the value of r, take the square root of both sides:

$$\sqrt{38.2} = r$$

We can use a calculator to find a more precise value of$\ \sqrt{38.2}$,
but looking at the answer choices, since 38.2 is close to 36,
$\sqrt{38.2}$ is close to 6 centimeters.
