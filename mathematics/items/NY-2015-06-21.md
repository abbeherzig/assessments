There are several ways to solve this problem. Here is one way: There is
a total of 1680 ounces of pet food. Since there are 16 ounces in each
pound, then there is a total of (1680/16)=105 pounds of food. Each bag
holds 5 pounds, so there the 105 pounds can fill (105/5) = 21 bags.

Another way to solve this is using unit conversions, like this:

$$1680\ ounces\  \times \frac{1\ pound}{16\ ounces} = 105\ pounds$$

$$105\ pounds\  \times \frac{1\ bag}{5\ pounds} = 21\ bags$$
