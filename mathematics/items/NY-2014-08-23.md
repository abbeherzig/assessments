Y = -2 is an equation that says that it doesn’t matter
what x is, because x is not even part of the equation. Y is always equal
to -2. If we try to graph that line, we can start with points like
(0,-2), (3,-2), (-1, -2). These points form a horizontal line, which is
parallel to the x-axis.

A vertical line always has the same value of x. That is represented in
choice 4, where x=12. For the other choices:

Y = -x is a line with slope -1, which is a diagonal line that goes down
from the upper right to the lower left.

Y=12 is an equation that says that it doesn’t matter what x is, because
x is not even part of the equation. Y is always equal to 12. To graph
that line, we can start with points like (0,12), (3,12), (-1, 12). These
points form a horizontal line, not a vertical one.

X=y is an equivalent equation to y=x, which is also a diagonal line.
This line has a slope of 1, rising from the lower left to the upper
right.
