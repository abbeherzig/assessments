This problem asks you to solve a system of two
equations:

$$6x + 5y = 300$$

$$3x + 7y = 285$$

There are several ways to find the values of x and y. Let’s start by
solving the first equation for x.

$$6x + 5y = 300$$

$$6x = 300 - 5y$$

Then divide by 5, to find

$$x = 50 - \ \frac{5}{6}y$$

We can substitute that equation for y in the second equation, like this:

$$3x + 7y = 285$$

$$3 \times \left( 50 - \frac{5}{6}y \right) + 7y = 285$$

This equation looks promising, since it only has one variable, *y*. If
we can solve this equation for *y*, we will have the cost of each
chocolate gift basket, which is what we are trying to find. Let’s start
by using the distributive property on the expression with parentheses:

$$3 \times 50 + 3 \times ( - \frac{5}{6})y + 7y = 285$$

$$150\  - \frac{15}{6}y + 7y = 285$$

We need a common denominator to combine the two *y* terms:

$$150\  - \frac{15}{6}y + \frac{42}{6}y = 285$$

$$150 + \frac{27}{6}y = 285$$

Which can be simplified (by factoring a 3) to:

$$150 + \frac{9}{2}y = 285$$

Now let’s get y by itself. Subtract 150 from both sides

$$\frac{9}{2}y = 135$$

And finally we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 9/2.

$$\frac{2}{9} \times \frac{9}{2}y = \frac{2}{9} \times 135$$

Since 9 goes into 135 15 times,

$$y = 2 \times 15 = 30$$

The cost of one chocolate gift basket is \$30.

There are many ways to solve this system of equations, but any solution
steps you follow will get you the same result.
