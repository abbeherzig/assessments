This problem asks for the number of combinations of
meat, condiment, and cheese. If you were choosing a sandwich, you could
choose 3 different types of meat, 3 different types of condiments, and 4
different types of cheese. The number of combinations is calculated as
$3 \times 3 \times 4 = 36$. For beef sandwiches, all the choices are
shown in this tree diagram:

The first sandwich is beef, ketchup, American. The second is Beef,
ketchup, cheddar, and so on. There are twelve possible beef sandwiches.
Following the same idea, there are 12 chicken sandwiches and 12 turkey
sandwiches, for a total of 36 sandwiches.

This calculation is an example of the counting principle, which you can
