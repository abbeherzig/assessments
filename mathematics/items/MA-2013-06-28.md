The *lateral surface area* of the tube is the area of
the piece of paper that forms the outside of the tube. If we unrolled
the paper, it would be a rectangle, like this:

![](media/image4.png){width="2.6458333333333335in"
height="2.8645833333333335in"}

The area of a rectangle is calculated as $Area = length\  \times width$.
The length is 8 inches, as shown in the diagram, and we have to find the
width.

When the paper was still rolled up into a tube, the end of the tube
formed a circle with diameter 3 inches. When the tube is unrolled, the
circumference of the circle becomes the width of the rectangle.

height="1.4583333333333333in"}

In any circle, the circumference is Ï€ times the diameter,

$Circumference = \ \pi d = 3.14 \times 3 = 9.42\ inches$

Now we know the length and width of the rectangular piece of paper, we
can calculate its area:

$$Area = length\  \times width = 8\ in\  \times 9.42\ inches = 75.36\ sq.\ in.$$

Which is closest to answer choice A.
