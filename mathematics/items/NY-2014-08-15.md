There are several ways to solve this problem. If the
parking lot is 100 yards long, then it is 300 feet long. Three quarters
of the parking lot is then

$$\frac{3}{4} \times 300\ ft = \ \frac{900}{4}ft = 225\ ft$$

You could also think of Â¾ as 75%, so the calculation becomes

$$75\% \times 300\ ft = \ 0.75 \times 300\ ft = 225\ ft$$

Three quarters of the parking lot is 225 feet long.
