The median of a set of data is the middle value when the
values are listed in order. In this set of data, we have data on 14
cars, so the median would be the average of the 7^th^ and 8^th^ cars.

Unfortunately, we don’t have the actual number of miles for these cars,
so we cannot identify the exact mileage of the 7^th^ and 8^th^ cars on
the list. We only know what range they fall into. Based on the table, if
we start with the lower mileage amounts, the 7^th^ car falls in the
2,001 – 4000 mile range, and the 8^th^ car falls into the 4,110 – 6000
mile range. The median is largest if the 7^th^ car and the 8^th^ car
have the highest mileage possible, which is 4000 miles and 6000 miles,
respectively. The average of those numbers is 5000 miles, so that is the
largest the median can be.
