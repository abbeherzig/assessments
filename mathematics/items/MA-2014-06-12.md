The area of the rectangle is calculated as
$A = lw = \left( 6\ in \right)\left( 24\ in \right) = 144\ sq\ in.$ To
find a square with the same area, remember that the area of a square is
calculated from the formula $A = s^{2}$.

Since the area of the square is the same as the area of the rectangle,
we know the area of the square is 144 sq in. Substituting this into the
equation for the area of a square, we get

$$144 = s^{2}$$

To find s by itself, take the square root of both sides of the equation:

$$\sqrt{144} = \sqrt{s^{2}}$$

$$12 = s$$

The solution to this is s=12. The side of the square is 12 inches long.

A square is a special kind of *polygon*, which is a two-dimensional
shape with straight sides. To review areas of polygons, see
