Two quantities vary directly if one is a constant
multiple of each other. In this case, if distance varies directly with
time, we can write the equation $d = r \times t$, where r is the
*constant of variation*. In the context of distance and time, r also
represents the speed.

The student walked 1 2/3 miles in 2/3 of an hour. Using the direct
variation formula above, we get

$$d = r \times t$$

$$1\frac{2}{3} = r \times \frac{2}{3}$$

If we can solve for r, we will know the constant of variation (and the
speed at which she walked). To solve for r, we need to divide both sides
by 2/3, or we can multiply by its reciprocal, 3/2.

$$1\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = r \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{2}$$

The multiplication on the left side will be easier if we re-write the
mixed number 1 2/3 as the equivalent improper fraction, 5/3. The two
fractions on the right side multiply to 1.

$$\frac{5}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = r$$

$$\frac{5}{2} = r$$

So we can write the direct variation formula as

$$d = \frac{5}{2} \times t$$
