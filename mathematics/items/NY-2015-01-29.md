If a function is multiplied by a number larger than 1,
then it will get taller, and a number between 0- and 1 will make it
shorter. Multiplying a function by a negative number flips it upside
down.

Dominick started with the absolute value function, which is shaped like
a V. Because a is positive, the V still opens upward. When Gina
multiplies this by -3, the negative sign flips it upside down, and the 3
makes it taller. The graph opens downward (because of the negative) and
is narrower (because the 3 made it taller).
