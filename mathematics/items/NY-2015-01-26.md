This problem is asking you to use the *Pythagorean Theorem*, which
applies to all right triangles. In a right triangle with sides a, b, and
c, with c being the hypotenuse, this relationship has to hold:

$a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$

You can test each of the given choices to see which works.

Choice 1:

Is it true that $7^{2} + 24^{2} = 25^{2}$? The left side of this
equation has a value of 49+576=625. The right side has a value of 625 as
well, so the equation holds. That means that these could be the
measurements of the sides of a right triangle.

If you try the same thing on any of the other choices given, you will
find that the equation does not hold.
