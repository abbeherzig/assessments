In this expression, 6 is called the *exponent* and it is
a shorthand for repeated multiplication. $x^{6}$ represents *x*
multiplied by itself 6 times.

$$x^{6} = x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x$$

$$x^{6} \bullet x^{2} = \left( x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \right) \bullet \left( x \bullet x \right) = \ x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x \bullet x = x^{8}$$

This is choice C.

In general $x^{a} \bullet x^{b} = x^{(a + b)}$.

You will see there some special rules for exponents that are negative
and fractions as well!
