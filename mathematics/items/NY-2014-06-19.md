The slope of a line is a number that measures how steep a line is. Since
we are told the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can find
the equation of the line using the slope-intercept form of the equation
of a line:

$$(y - y_{1}) = m(x - x_{1})$$

In this equation, *m* is a number representing the slope, and (*x~1~,
y~1~*) are the coordinates of the point on the line. X and y are the two
variables that are used to represent the line in the x-y plane.
Substituting in the information we are given that \( = - \frac{4}{3} \),
*x*,=3 and *y~1~* = -7, we get

$$\left( y - \left( - 7 \right) \right) = - \frac{4}{3}(x - 3)$$

Looking at the answer choices, we see that we are expected to re-write
this equation so that the variable y is alone on one side of the
equation. To re-write this equation:

$$y + 7 = - \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{4}{3}( - 3)$$

$$y + 7 = - \frac{4}{3}x + 4$$

And subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation,

$$y = - \frac{4}{3}x - 3$$

This is choice 2.
