On Monday, Brooke rode her bicycle at 15 miles/hour for
0.4 hours. To find the length of Maple Street, we can use the *distance
formula*:

$$Distance = Rate \times Time$$

$$Distance = 15\ \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}} \times 0.4\ hours = 6\ miles$$

Maple Street is 6 miles long. On Tuesday, she rode the length of Maple
street in 0.3 hours. We can use the distance formula again:

$$Distance = Rate \times Time$$

$$6\ miles = Rate \times 0.3\ hours$$

To find her speed (rate), divide both sides by 0.3 hours:

$$\frac{6\ miles}{0.3\ hours} = \frac{Rate \times 0.3\ hours}{0.3\ hours}$$

$$20\ miles/hour = Rate$$

Her speed on Tuesday was 20 mph, which is choice B. Note that since she
rode the same distance on Monday and Tuesday, but on Tuesday it took her
less time, she must have ridden faster on Tuesday than she did on
Monday, so choices C and D would not be possible.
