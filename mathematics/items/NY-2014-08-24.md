This story problem describes two variables, which we can
call *d* (number of dimes) and *q* (number of quarters). We are told
there are 72 coins total, so

$$d + q = 72$$

We also know that the value of those coins totals \$14.70. Since each
dime has a value of 10 cents, or \$0.10, the value of *d* dimes is
0.10*d*. Similarly, since each quarter is worth 25 cents or \$0.25, *q*
quarters have a value of 0.25*q*. The total value can be written as

$$0.10d + 0.25q = \$ 14.70$$

Since all the answer choices only use the variable *q*, we need to find
a way to express this pair of equations using only that variable. Notice
that the first equation can be written as

$$d = 72 - q$$

This equation says that the number of dimes is equal to 72 minus the
number of quarters. Substitute that expression into the second equation,
to get

$$0.10(72 - q) + 0.25q = \$ 14.70$$
