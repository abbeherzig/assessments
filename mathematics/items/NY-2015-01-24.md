The height of the model rocket is modeled by the equation

$$p\left( x \right) = \  - 16x^{2} + 32x$$

That means that at any time after the rocket is launched, we can find
how high it is above the ground by substituting that value for x into
this equation. To find the length of time the rocket is in the air, we
need to find when its height is zero, which is when it hits the ground.
If the height is zero, then

$$- 16x^{2} + 32x = 0$$

This is a *quadratic* equation, and there are several ways to solve it.
To make this simpler to work with, divide both sides by -16, and then
factor.

$$x^{2} - 2x = 0$$

$$x(x - 2) = 0$$

Here we are multiplying two quantities. The only way their product can
be zero is if one or the other is zero, so either x=0 or (x-2)=0. The
solution to this equation is that x=0 or x=2, which are the two times
that the rocket is at ground level. That means that the rocket spends 2
seconds in the air.
