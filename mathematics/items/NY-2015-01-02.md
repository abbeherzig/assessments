There are two ways to solve this problem. The shortest
way is to notice that, in order to get n by itself, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.2.

$$0.2\left( n - 6 \right) = 2.8$$

$$\frac{0.2(n - 6)}{0.2} = \frac{2.8}{0..2}$$

$$n - 6 = 14$$

Then add 6 to both sides of the equation, so n=20.

A different way to solve the equation is to use the distributive
property:

$$0.2\left( n - 6 \right) = 2.8$$

$$0.2 \times n - 0.2 \times 6 = 2.8$$

$$0.2n - 1.2 = 2.8$$

Then add 1.2 to both sides, to get 0.2n = 4.0. Divide both sides by 0.2, and get n=20.
