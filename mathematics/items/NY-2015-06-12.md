A *correlation* measures how strongly associated two
variables are. If x and y are highly correlated, then when you graph the
values of x and y, the points will fall very close to a straight lie. A
positive correlation means that as x increases, y increases as well. A
negative correlation means that as x increases, y decreases. No
correlation (or zero correlation) means that there is no linear pattern
between the variables. In this graph, the points fall approximately on a
line, so the variables are correlated. The line decreases from left to
right (negative slope), so the correlation is negative. This is choice
3.
