The length of the rectangle is $2 + \sqrt{45}$ cm. Since

$$36 < 45 < 49$$

We know that

$$\sqrt{36} < \sqrt{45} < \sqrt{49}$$

So

$6 < \sqrt{45} < 7$.

Also, 45 is much closer to 49 than to 36, so $\sqrt{45}$ is closer to
$\sqrt{49}$ than to $\sqrt{36}$ , so $\sqrt{45}$ is closer to 7 than it
is to 6. If we add 2 to each expression, we see that

$$8 < 2 + \sqrt{45} < 9$$

And since $\sqrt{45}$ is almost 7, $2 + \sqrt{45}$ almost 9. Of the
given choices, 8.7 is the best estimate.
