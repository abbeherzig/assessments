Since the slope of a line measures its steepness or
direction, parallel lines have the same slope. When the equation of a
line is written as y = mx + b, the value of m ( the coefficient of x, or
the number multiplying x, is the slope. The equation give, y = -3x, has
a slope of -3, so we need to find which of the answer choices has a
slope of -3. If we express each of the choices in that standard form, we
can see which has that slope.

1.  $\frac{1}{3}x + y = 4$ is equivalent to $y = \  - \frac{1}{3}x + 4$,
    so this line has a slope of $- \frac{1}{3}$

2.  $1\frac{1}{3}x + y = 4$ is equivalent to $y = \ \frac{1}{3}x + 4$,
    so this line has a slope of $\frac{1}{3}$

3.  $6x + 2y = 4$ is equivalent to $y = \  - 3x + 2$, so this line has a
    slope of $- 3$

4.  $- 6x + 2y = 4$ is equivalent to $y = \ 3x + 2$, so this line has a
    slope of $3$

Of these choices, only \#3 has the same slope as the given equation, so
those two lines are parallel.
