If we know two points, there is only one line that goes
through them both. To find the equation of that line, we need to start
by finding the slope. Remember that

$slope = \ \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{y_{2} - \ y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} = \ \frac{1 - ( - 5)}{2 - \left( 6 \right)} = \frac{1 + 5}{2 - 6} = \ \frac{6}{- 4} = - \frac{3}{2}$

We can then use the *point-slope form* of the equation of a line:

$$y - \ y_{1} = m(x - x_{1})$$

We can substitute the slope we just calculated as m=-3/2, and use either
one of the two points on the line. If we use (2,1), the equation
becomes:

$$y - \ 1 = - \frac{3}{2}(x - 2)$$

If we use (6, -5), the equation is

$$y - \left( \  - 5 \right) = - \frac{3}{2}(x - 6)$$

Both of these can be simplified to

$$y = - \frac{3}{2}x - 4$$

numbers. To see more about signed integers, see
