A *geometric sequence* is a list of numbers that follow a
very specific pattern: each number is a multiple of the number before,
and that multiple is always the same. For the sequence shown, we first
have to figure out what that multiple is. Notice the following pattern:

> **4** x 3 = 12
>
> **12** x 3 = 36
>
> **36** x 3 = 108
>
> **108** x 3 = 324

Since each term in the sequence is 3 times the previous term, this is a
*geometric sequence with common ratio 3*. To find the next term, we just
have to calculate

> 324 x 3 = 972
