The area of a triangle is calculated as

$$A = \ \frac{1}{2}\text{bh}$$

*b* stands for the base of the triangle, and *h* stands for the height.
To find the area of the triangle, we need to find the values of *b* and
*h*. From the graph, count the number of boxes across the base of the
triangle to find *b* = 8. Count the number of boxes from the bottom to
the top of the triangle to find *h* = 7. Substituting these values into
the area formula gives us

$$A = \ \frac{1}{2} \bullet 8 \bullet 7 = 4 \bullet 7 = 28$$

The area of the triangle is 28 square units.
