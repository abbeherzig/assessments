This graph shows an X for each studio in the art center.
Each X is placed over the number of square feet in area of that studio. We could also show these data in a table like this:

  Area of Studio (sq. Ft)  | Number of studios
  -------------------------|-------------------
  800                      | 2
  900                      | 0
  1000                     | 3
  1100                     | 2
  1200                     | 1
  1300                     | 1
  1400                     | 0
  1500                     | 1

The mean area is calculated as the total area of all the studios divided
by the number of studios. (The mean is the mathematical term for what we
usually think of as the average.) From the table, we can calculate

$$Mean\ area = \frac{\text{total area}}{\text{number of studios}}$$

$$= \frac{(2\  \times 800) + (0 \times 900) + (3 \times 1000) + (2 \times 1100) + (1 \times 1200) + (1 \times 1300) + (0 \times 1400) + (1 \times 1500)}{10}$$

$$= \frac{10,800}{10}$$

$$= 1,080\ square\ feet$$

This is choice D.
