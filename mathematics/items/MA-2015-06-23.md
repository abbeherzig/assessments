For any real numbers e and f, e + f = f + e. This is
called the *commutative property of addition*, and basically says that
numbers can be added in either order and the result is the same. For
example, 7 + 4 = 4 + 7, and this property holds for any real numbers.
The *commutative property of multiplication* says that e · f = f· e for
any real numbers e and f, saying that numbers can be multiplied any
order. For example, 3 · 2 = 2 · 3, and this property holds for any real
numbers.

However, these properties do not hold for subtraction and division. 5 –
3 is not equal to 3 – 5, and $6 \div 3$ is not equal to $3 \div 6$.

This commutative property only holds for addition and multiplication, so
only two of the equations are true (choice B).
