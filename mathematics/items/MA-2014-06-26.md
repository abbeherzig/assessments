The *x-intercept* of a line, or any graph on the
*Cartesian plane* (that's the actual name of the x-y axes), is the point
where the graph crosses the x-axis.

In Graph A, the x-intercept is x = -2, so this is the correct choice.

In Graph B, the x-intercept is x = Â½.

In Graph C, the x-intercept is x = 0.

In Graph D, the x-intercept is x = 2.

For graphs of functions more complicated than lines, there may be more
than one x-intercept, and the x-intercepts are called the *roots* or
*zeros* of the function.
