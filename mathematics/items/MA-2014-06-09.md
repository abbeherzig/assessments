The mean of a set of numbers is their average: add the
bowling scores and divide by the number of scores being averaged, which
is 9. The median is the middle value of a set of numbers when they are
listed in order from largest to smallest (or from smallest to largest).

Notice from this list that the high score of 194 is much higher than the
other scores. We can consider it an *outlier*. When there is an extreme
value like this, it makes the mean larger, because it makes the total of
the scores bigger, but it does not affect the median. For example, if
the person who bowled a 194 had bowled 230 instead, the middle value
would still be 95, so the median would not change. However, the total of
the scores would be bigger, so the mean would be larger as well (112
instead of 108).

The mean is so much higher than the median because of this high value,
which is stated in Choice D.

The mean and median are two examples of *measures of central tendency*,
or ways to describe a “typical” value. You can review more about
medians, means, and the effects of outliers on them, here:
