The slope of a line is a number that measures how steep a line is. To
determine the equation of a line, we need to know either two points on
the line, or the slope and a point. In this problem, we are told the
slope and one point, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the
equation of a line:

$$(y - y<sub>1</sub>) = m(x - x<sub>1</sub>)$$

In this equation, *m* is a number representing the slope, and (x<sub>1</sub>,
y<sub>1</sub>) are the two numbers that are the coordinates of the point on the
line. x and y are the two variables that are used to represent the line
in the x-y plane. Substituting in the information we are given that *m*
= 3 and the point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) = (-2, -8), we get

$$(y - \left( - 8 \right)) = 3(x - ( - 2))$$

When using this equation, it is important to put x<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>1</sub> in the
correct place! Looking at the answer choices, we see that we are
expected to re-write this equation in slope-intercept form, so that the
variable y is alone on one side of the equation. To re-write this
equation:

$$y + 8 = 3(x + 2)$$

$$y + 8 = 3x + 6$$

And subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation,

$$y = 3x - 2$$

This is choice 1.
