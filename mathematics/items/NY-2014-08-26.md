This question asks you to re-arrange the algebraic
equation so that x appears alone on one side of the equation. Start by
adding bx to both sides:

> ax + 3 = 7 â€“ bx
>
> +bx +bx
>
> ax+bx + 3 = 7

Then subtract 3 from both sides:

ax + bx = 4

Now the equation is written in an equivalent form, with all the terms
including an x on the left side. We can use the distributive property to
factor an x from the left side:

(a + b)x = 4

Then divide both sides by (a+b) to find

$$x = \frac{4}{a + b}$$
