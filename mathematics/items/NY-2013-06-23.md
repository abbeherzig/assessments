We are asked to write an expression to represent the number of hours in
w weeks and d days. Since we know there are 24 hours in a day, letâ€™s
create a table to help us observe a pattern:

Days        | Hours
------------|--------------
1           | 24
2           | 2 x 24 = 48
3           | 3 x 24 = 72
4           | 4 x 24 = 96
5           | 5 x 24 = 120
6           | 6 x 24 = 144
7 (1 week)  | 7 x 24 =168

In general, *d* days have *d* x 24 hours, which can also be written as
*24d* hours.

At the bottom of the table we see that 1 week has 168 hours, so 2 weeks
have 2 x 168 = 336 hours. In general, w weeks have w x 168 hours, which
can be written as *168w* hours.

In total, *w* weeks and *d* days will have *168w + 24d* hours, which is
choice 3.

Making tables and observing patterns are two helpful tools for solving
problems. You can see more examples of these and other problem solving
