Since Leah drove for 5 days, you might be tempted to say
that she drove about 20% of the trip on the first day. But be careful!
Looking at the table, we see that she drove more in the first day than
on any other day. In total, she drove 297 + 179 + 203 + 131 + 192 = 1002
miles. On Day 1 she drove approximately 300 miles. We can estimate the
fraction of the entire trip she drove on Day one as approximately
300/1000 =30/100 = 30%.
