The graph of an inequality has two important elements: the line that
defines the boundary between the shaded and unshaded region, and the
shaded region itself.

First, let's look at the line itself. The inequality is

$$2y + 6 > 4x$$

In order to find the line that defines the boundary, it is easiest to
re-write the equation in *slope-intercept form*, which has y by itself
on one side of the inequality. To get y by itself, start by subtracting
6 from both sides, which results in

$$2y > 4x - 6$$

Then divide both sides by 2:

$$y > \frac{4x - 6}{2}$$

$$y > \frac{4}{2}x - \frac{6}{2}$$

$$y > 2x - 3$$

That equation says that the y-intercept (the point on the y-axis where
the line crosses) is -3, and the slope is 2. All of the answer choices
show that line.

Now we have to examine the inequality, which has two characteristics on
the graph: whether the line is included (solid line) or excluded (dashed
line), and whether to shade above or below the line. Since the
inequality uses the *greater than* symbol, that tells us that the value
of y is above the line, but not equal to the values on the line (so it
is a dotted line), which is shown in Graph 3, the correct choice.

Graphs 1 and 2 show all values of y below the line, which is represented
by the inequalities \( y < 2x - 3 \) (Graph 1) and \( y \leq 2x - 3 \) (Graph
2). Graphs 2 and 4 both show solid lines, which means that the line is
included in the possible values of y. This is represented using the two
symbols for *less than or equal to* (≤) for Graph 2 and *greater than or
equal to* (≥) for Graph 4.
