It does not make sense to divide by zero. For example, 8
divided into 2 groups yields 4 in each group. But what does it mean to
divide 8 into zero groups? Mathematically, that is meaningless. A
fraction with a zero in the denominator is called *undefined.* In this
expression, the denominator is zero when

$$4x + 28 = 0$$

Subtract 28 from both sides and then divide by 4, to find x = 7. You can
verify that the fraction is undefined for x=7 by substituting x=7 into
the expression. X=7 makes the denominator of that expression zero, so it
is undefined.
