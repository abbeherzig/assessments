There are several ways to solve this problem. Here is one way: First,
letâ€™s figure out how many yards Nick rode his bike last year. He rode
8000 miles, and there are 1760 yards in a mile, so Nick rode

$$8000\ miles\  \times \frac{1760\ yards}{\text{mile}} = 14,080,000\ yards$$

That is for the entire year, so his daily average is

$$\frac{14,080,000\ yards}{365\ days} = 38,575\ yards/day$$
