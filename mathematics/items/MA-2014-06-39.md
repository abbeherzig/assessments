90째 rotational symmetry (also called rotational
symmetry order 4) means that you can rotate the picture by 90째 and it
will look exactly the same as it did before it was rotated. Only picture
D has this property. The other pictures all have 180째 rotational
symmetry, meaning that they can be turned by 180째 and still look the
same.
