Most of the time, simplifying an inequality is similar
to simplifying an equation. (We just have to be very careful if we
multiply or divide by a negative number!).

25x â€“ 100 &lt; 250

Add 100 to both sides, to get

25x &lt; 350

Then divide both sides by 25, to get

X &lt; 14

The only choice that meets this requirement is choice (1), because 13
&lt; 14. You might be tempted to choose 14, but be careful 14: It is
*not true* that 14 &lt; 14.
