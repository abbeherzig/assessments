The vertex of a parabola is the point at which it turns
around. For a parabola open downward like this one, the vertex is the
highest point. Reading from the graph, that point is (3,8). The *axis of
symmetry* is the line that can be drawn through the middle of the
parabola so that the part on one side of the line is symmetric with the
part on the other side of the lineâ€”the two sides are mirror images of
each other. In this graph, the axis of symmetry is the vertical line
drawn at x=3. Combined, this gives us choice 1.
