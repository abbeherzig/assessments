This calculation requires a combination of using
scientific notation and algebraic operations with exponents. Start with
the product on the left side of the equation:

$$\left( 7.6 \times 10^{n} \right)\left( 3.5 \times 10^{3} \right) = \left( \ 7.6 \times 3.5 \right) \times 10^{(n + 3)}$$

$= 26.6\  \times \ 10^{(n + 3)}$

We can write this in standard scientific notation by moving the decimal
one place to the left, and then adjusting the exponent on the 10.

$$26.6 \times 10^{(n + 3)} = \left( 2.66 \times 10 \right) \times 10^{\left( n + 3 \right)}\ $$

$$= 2.66 \times \left( 10\  \times 10^{\left( n + 3 \right)} \right)\ \ \ \ \ (using\ the\ associative\ property\ of\ multiplication)\ $$

$$= 2.66 \times \left( 10^{\left( n + 3 \right) + 1} \right)\text{\ \ \ \ }$$

Compare that expression to the right side of the equation in the
original calculation, and you see that the the exponents on the 10â€™s
need to be equal, so

(n+3) + 1 = 9

N+4 = 9

N=5
