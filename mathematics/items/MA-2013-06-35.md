To simplify this *rational expression*, we have to start
by factoring each quadratic:

$$\frac{x^{2} + x - 6}{x^{2} + 5x + 6} = \ \frac{(x + 3)(x - 2)}{(x + 3)(x + 2)}$$

(You can check if you believe that factorization by multiplying the
monomials on the right side using FOIL.) If x=-3 or x=-2, the
denominator would be zero, and we can't have a denominator of zero. But
we were asked to consider only positive values of x, so we do not have
to be concerned by these values. Notice that there is a factor of (x +
3) in the numerator and denominator. We can simplify this expression
(what you may remember as *cancelling*), as follows:

$$\ \frac{(x + 3)(x - 2)}{(x + 3)(x + 2)} = \ \frac{x + 3}{x + 3} \times \frac{x - 2}{x + 2} = 1 \times \frac{x - 2}{x + 2} = \ \frac{x - 2}{x + 2}$$

Which is choice C.
