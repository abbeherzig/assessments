If we know two points, there is only one line that goes
through them both. To find the equation of that line, we need to start
by finding the slope. Remember that

$slope = \ \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{y_{2} - \ y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} = \ \frac{10 - ( - 2)}{3 - \left( - 1 \right)} = \ \frac{12}{4} = 3$

We can then use the *point-slope form* of the equation of a line:

$$y - \ y_{1} = m(x - x_{1})$$

We can substitute the slope we just calculated as m=3, and use either
one of the two points on the line. If we use (3,10), the equation
becomes:

$$y - \ 10 = 3(x - 3)$$

If we use (-1, -2), the equation is

$$y - (\  - 2) = 3(x - ( - 1))$$

Both of these can be simplified to y = 3x + 1, which is choice 1.
