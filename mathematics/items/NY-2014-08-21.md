We need to find the mean, the median, and the mode of
Kelsey's scores.

The *mode* is the value that occurs most frequenly in the data. The most
common score is 22 (she scored 22 points in two separate games, and no
other point value happened more than once). Mode=22.

The *median* is the value that occurs in the middle, if all the scores
are listed in order from largest to smallest. Her scores are 8, 14, 17,
19, 22, and 22. There are six values, so the middle, or the *median*, is
the average of the third and fourth values, which is (22+19)/2 = 20.5.

The *mean* is the traditional average, calculated by adding up all the
scores and dividing by the number of scores. The mean =
(22+14+19+22+8+17)/6 = 17.

The mode is largest, followed by the median, and then the mean, which is
choice 1.
