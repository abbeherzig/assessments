The surface area of a sphere with radius *r* is
calculated using the formula

$$Surface\ Area = \ 4\pi r^{2}$$

If a larger sphere has a radius 8 times as large, then its radius is 8r
and its surface area is

$$Surface\ Area = \ 4\pi{(8r)}^{2}$$

Notice that the exponent applies to the entire expression in
parentheses, so this can be re-written

$Surface\ Area = \ 4\pi({8^{2}r}^{2}$)

$$= \ 4\pi{\times 64 \times r}^{2}$$

Using the commutative property of multiplication, we can re-write this
as

$$= \ 64 \times 4\pi r^{2}$$

The surface area of the smaller sphere with radius *r* is $4\pi r^{2}$,
and the surface area of the larger sphere is $64 \times 4\pi r^{2}$.
That means that the surface area of the larger sphere is 64 times as
large as the surface area of the smaller sphere.
