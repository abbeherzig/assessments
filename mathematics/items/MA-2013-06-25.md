To find the values for *x* that satisfy the expression

$$- 2 < 2x + 6\  \leq 12$$

we have to do some algebraic manipulation in order to get the *x* by
itself. In most cases, we can follow the same steps as we would follow
with an equation. In this case, we start by subtracting 6 from all 3
parts of the inequality:

$$- 2 - 6 < 2x + 6 - 6 \leq 12 - 6$$

$$- 8 < 2x \leq 6$$

Now we have to do something to remove the 2, so we divide all 3 parts of
the inequality by 2:

$$\frac{- 8}{2} < \frac{2x}{2} \leq \frac{6}{2}$$

$$- 4 < x \leq 3$$

Now we have to choose which graph reflects this inequality. This
inequality says that x is between -4 and 3. The &lt; symbol on the left
means that x is larger than -4, but cannot be equal to -4. That is shown
on the graph with an open circle. The â‰¤ symbol on the right means that x
is less than or equal to 3 (it is either less than 3 or equal to 3),
which we show on the graph with a closed circle. This is shown in choice
B.

There are similarities between solving inequalities and solving
equations, but things get interesting if you want to multiply or divide
by a negative number.
