The flower is perpendicular to the ground, so the drawing shows a *right
triangle*. We know the length of the side opposite angle x, and the side
adjacent to angle x. We can use the trigonometric ratio *tangent* to
find the measure of the angle.

$$tan\ x = \ \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{5}{9.5} = 0.5263$$

Since the tangent of x is equal to 0.5263, we can use a calculator to
find the inverse tangent (also called arc tangent) of 0.5263. tan^-1^
(0.5263)=27.76. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree, this is 27.8
degrees.

  $$\sin{x =}\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypoten}\text{use}}$$

  $$\cos{x =}\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

  $$\tan{x =}\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$
