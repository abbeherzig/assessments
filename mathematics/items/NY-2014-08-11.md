If we know two points, there is only one line that goes
through them both. To find the slope of that line, remember that slope =
rise/run.

$slope = \ \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{y_{2} - \ y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} = \ \frac{- 3 - 5}{5 - ( - 7)} = \ \frac{- 8}{5 + 7} = \frac{- 8}{12} = - \frac{8}{12} = \  - \frac{2}{3}$

interactive graph to where you can experiment with different examples:
