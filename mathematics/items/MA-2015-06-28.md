For the Blake family, 3 drinks cost 3<i>d</i> dollars, and 2
snacks cost 2<i>s</i> dollars. They spent 12 dollars total, which we can write
as

$$3d + 2s = 12$$

For the Reese family, 2 drinks cost 2<i>d</i> dollars, and 4 snacks cost 4<i>s</i>
dollars. They spent 16 dollars total, which we can write as

$$2d + 4s = 16$$

There are several ways to solve *2 equations in 2 unknowns* (the
mathematical way to say that we have two equations that both use the
same two variables). Here is one way:

Let's re-write the Reese family to solve for d:

$$ 2d + 4s = 16$$
$$10\%\ of\ 14\ hours = 0.10 \times 14 = 1.4$$

Subtract *4s* from both sides
$$ 2d = 16 – 4s$$

Divide both sides by 2: 
$$ d = 8 – 2s$$

We can now go back to the Blake family equation, and substitute this
expression for *d*:

$$ 3d + 2s = 12$$

Substitute *d = 8 – 2s*: 
$$ 3(8 – 2s) + 2s = 12$$

Use the distributive property to evaluate the parentheses: 
$$3 \times 8 - 3 \times 2s + 2s = 12$$

Combine like terms: 
$$ 24 – 4s = 12$$

Subtract 24 from both sides: 
$$- 4s = 12 – 24$$
$$ -4s = -12$$
$$ s = 3$$

A snack costs \$3. We were asked to find the cost of a drink, so we can
use the equation for either family to find the value of *d*. Using the
Blake family equation:

$$3d + 2s = 12$$
$$3d + 2(3) = 12$$
$$3d + 6 = 12$$
$$3d = 6$$
$$d = 2$$

So a drink costs \$2.

You can check that these results make sense by using s=\$3 and d=\$2 in
the equation for the Reese family.
