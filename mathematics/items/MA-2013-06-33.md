A *geometric sequence* is a list of numbers in which
each number is the same multiple of the number before. The multiple is
called the *common ratio* of the sequence. For example, the numbers

2, 6, 18, 54, 162, . . . .

Is a geometric sequence with common ratio 3, because each number is 3
times the previous number. In the sequence given, need to find the
common ratio, which is what each number is multiplied by to find the
next number. Let's examine the first two terms:

$- \frac{25}{2} \times r = \ \frac{125}{4}$, so
$r = \ \frac{125}{4} \times ( - \frac{2}{25})$ = $- \frac{5}{2}$

It seems that the common ratio is $r = - \frac{5}{2}$. Let's see if that
works as the multiple to get from the second term to the third term:

$\frac{125}{4} \times r = \ \frac{125}{4} \times \left( - \frac{5}{2} \right) = - \frac{625}{8}\ $,
which is the third term. You can continue like this to verify that if
each number in the sequence is multiplied by $r = - \frac{5}{2}$, the
result is the next number in the sequence, sot that is our common ratio,
which is choice D.
