If Force varies directly with the length the spring is
stretched, that is another way of saying that the force and the length
are proportional. In other words, if the force doubles, the length of
the spring doubles. If the force triples, the length triples. We are
told that a force of 20 Newtons stretches a spring 5 cm. A force of 60
Newtons is 3 times as much force, so it would stretch the spring 3 times
the length, which is 15 cm.
