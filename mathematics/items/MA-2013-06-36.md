We are asked to find the measure of
$\measuredangle JGH$, which is part of $GHJ$. Unfortunately, we don’t
know any of the angle measures in that triangle, so we have to turn to
$KLM$ instead. In a triangle, the sum of the measures of all three
angles is 180°. Since we know the measures of two of the angles, we can
calculate the third angle like this:

height="1.7083333333333333in"}

Since the two triangles are congruent, written as $GHJ \cong KLM$, their
corresponding angles are also congruent. That means that the measure of
$\measuredangle JGH$ in the top triangle is the same as the measure of
its corresponding angle in the lower triangle.

But which angle corresponds to of $\measuredangle JGH$? The clue is in
how the triangles are named.

Since we are told that $GHJ \cong KLM$ , the order in which each
triangle is named tells us that:

$$\measuredangle G \cong \measuredangle K$$

$$\measuredangle H \cong \measuredangle L$$

$\measuredangle J \cong \measuredangle M$

So $\measuredangle JGH$, which is another name for $\measuredangle G$,
is congruent to $\measuredangle K$. Since we found that
m$\measuredangle K$=30°, then m$\measuredangle G$=30°, which is choice
A.
