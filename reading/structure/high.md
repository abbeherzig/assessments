**Description**

This domain assesses your ability to analyze the structure of ideas in texts. The primary skills covered by this domain are understanding how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of a text (e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole; identifying transitional words and phrases used within and between parts of a text; observing sentence-level structures such as punctuation marks used to shape or inflect meaning; and perceiving larger patterns of organization and rhetorical strategies that shape the overall development of ideas in a text (e.g., cause and effect, comparison and contrast, and chronological order).

**Challenges**

Part of being able to understand what a text says is to understand how it says it. This requires an ability to analyze the structure of a textâ€”how information is organized to deliver a persuasive argument. Texts are often structured to follow commonly used writing patterns, such as cause and effect or sequence. For instance, the information in history texts is commonly organized sequentially by chronological order, whereas the information in science textbooks is often organized by categories or by cause and effect. Knowing the structure of the text will greatly improve your ability to anticipate and understand what it says.
