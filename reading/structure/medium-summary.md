This domain assesses your ability to analyze the structure of ideas in texts. The primary skills covered by this domain are understanding how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of a text (e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole; identifying transitional words and phrases used within and between parts of a text; observing sentence-level structures such as punctuation marks used to shape or inflect meaning; and perceiving larger patterns of organization and rhetorical strategies that shape the overall development of ideas in a text (e.g., cause and effect, comparison and contrast, and chronological order).
