This domain assesses your ability to read closely to determine implied meaning. The primary skill covered by this domain is drawing logical inferences from what texts say explicitly to determine implied meaning. An inference is an educated guess about the implied meaning of a passage or text based on a combination of evidence from the text and reasoning. It is sometimes referred to as "reading between the lines."
