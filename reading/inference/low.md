**Description**

This domain assesses your ability to read closely to determine implied meaning. The primary skill covered by this domain is drawing logical inferences from what texts say explicitly in order to determine implied meaning. An inference is an educated guess about the implied meaning of a passage or text based on a combination of evidence from the text and reasoning. It is sometimes referred to as “reading between the lines.”

**Challenges**

Many texts convey information using indirect or suggestive language. For instance, it's common for authors to imply their thesis (main argument), or to require the reader to “read between the lines” to understand what is being communicated. This is particularly common in literary texts, advertising media, and persuasive texts. Therefore, it is important to be able to infer (make an educated guess based on evidence and logic) what the text is saying. Failure to infer meaning, or to make faulty inferences, may lead to misunderstanding.
