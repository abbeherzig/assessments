    On the day that gold was discovered near his village, Mohammed Muda Nor had
worked all morning tapping rubber.<sup>1</sup> At one o'clock he walked out from the airy rows of
trees, waved to Abdullah, the entry guard, who was already eating his lunch, and started
down the dusty road home. The call to prayer wavered from the village mosque, and it
seemed to Muda that he could see it, waves of sound shimmering concurrently with the
midday heat. It was the end of the fruit season, one of the last hot weeks before the rains
began, and the weather was a fiery hand against his back. Muda walked with his straw hat
pulled down low over his forehead, so he didn't see the children running toward him until
they were quite near. They circled around him and pulled in close, like the petals on a closing
flower.
    "Pachik Muda." It was his oldest nephew, a boy named Amin. He was wearing shorts
and holding the hand of his youngest sister, Maimunah, who stood brown and naked beside
him. "Uncle, our mother says for you to come quickly to the river." ...
    "Tell your mother," he said, "that I will come later. Right now I am going for my lunch."
He expected them to run off then. They were the children of his sister, Norliza, and they
were rarely naughty. But instead Amin released his sister's hand. He reached out and
tugged at Muda's sarong.<sup>2</sup>
    "My mother says to come," he repeated. "Please, Pachik Muda, she says it is important."
    Muda sighed then, but he turned and followed the children back along the road. Red
rambutans<sup>3</sup> and smooth green mangoes hung from the trees. He plucked some of these and
ate them as he walked, wondering what he would find on the riverbank. Norliza had worked
the rubber too, before she married, and she would not take him lightly from his rest and
prayers.
    When he reached the river he saw a cluster of women standing on the grassy bank.
Norliza was in the center, her sarong wet to the knees, holding something out for the 
others to see.
    "Norliza," he called. He was going to scold her for consuming his time with her bit of
woman's nonsense, but before he could speak she ran to him and uncurled her fist. The
lines in her palm were creased with dirt, so that the skin around them looked very pale. The
words he had planned stopped in his mouth. For on her palm lay a piece of gold as large as
a knuckle. It was wet with river water, and it caught the noon light like fire in her hand.
    "The children found it," she said. "I was digging for roots." Norliza was a midwife,
known in the village for her skill with herbs and massage. She came into the jungle every
week to search for the healing roots and bark. "I was digging there, near the trees by the
river. The children were playing next to me, sorting out the rocks for a game. This one they
liked because of its shine. At first I did not realize. It was only when Amin washed it in the
river that I understood." Her dark eyes gleamed with an unfamiliar excitement. "To think,"
she said. "To think he might have dropped it, and I would never have known."
    Muda reached out and took the knot of gold. It was smooth, almost soft, against his 
fingers. He ran his thumb against it again and again. Some of the women drew close to
stare. Others, he noticed, were already moving away with the news. ...
