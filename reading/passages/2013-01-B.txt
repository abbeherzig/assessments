    You never forget your first iceberg.
    The mass of drifting ice that dwarfs your ship is so beautiful, yet so improbable
looking, that you simply gaze in wonder. It seems that nothing that large could be natural-
and then it strikes you that something so enormous could only be natural.
Another realization soon dawns: These rock-hard floating mountains are dangerous.
Think not only of the 1912 <i>Titanic</i> disaster but of hundreds of other accidents, most
recently the sinking (with no loss of life) of the Antarctic tour ship <i>Explorer</i> in
November 2007. ...
    Now, as climate change is raising global temperatures, more icebergs are being born.
Antarctica generates far more of them than Greenland, the source of bergs in Arctic waters.
Antarctica's are also much larger, sometimes reaching the size of small countries. Recent
data show the average atmospheric temperature has increased about 4.5 degrees
Fahrenheit in the western Antarctic Peninsula since the 1940s, making the region, along
with northwestern North America and Siberia, among the fastest warming on earth. This
jump has been implicated in the recent collapse of major ice shelves along the Antarctic
Peninsula, including the Wilkins Ice Shelf in 2008. As a result, thousands of new icebergs
have calved, or broken off, from ice shelves into the Southern Ocean at an accelerated rate.
    Even as more icebergs are being created, scientists are learning that these
dangerous beauties are far from sterile, inert masses of ice. In fact, they dramatically alter
their environments biologically, chemically, and physically, making them islands of life in
the open sea. Knowledge of icebergs' crucial role in the Antarctic ecosystem has come only
in recent years. Observers at sea had long remarked that they attract seals, penguins, and
seabirds, and divers had noticed that fish are more numerous near them than in the
surrounding sea. Now scientists are learning just what the attraction is all about.
    Depending on their size, location, and the season, icebergs can be nurturers or
destroyers. During their existence-typically years from calving from an Antarctic or
Greenlandic glacier to their gradual melting as they drift into lower latitudes-they support
animals on, around, even <i>inside</i> their magnificent ramparts. They fertilize the ocean with
nutrients, boosting plankton production. Grounded bergs can shelter areas of the seafloor,
protecting bottom-dwelling creatures from free-floating icebergs, which can be
bottom-scouring marauders, furrowing the seabed at depths of more than a thousand feet
like gigantic plows, destroying all marine life unable to move out of the way. Large bergs
can also trap sea ice, impeding its annual breakup and thus depriving phytoplankton (algae
that take their name from the Greek words for "plant" and "wanderer") of life-giving
sunlight, breaking the food chain at its first link. ...
    From personal experience, I know that icebergs will continue to astonish and
captivate visitors to the polar regions with their size and ethereal<sup>1</sup> beauty. But now-just
when these ecosystems are in rapid flux due to global climate change-these frozen
masses are taking on a new dimension of wonder as we uncover their critical role in the
biology and chemistry of polar seas. No longer can we look at icebergs as mere passive
beauties. They are active agents of change, each one an icy oasis trailing a wake of life as it
drifts on its inexorable<sup>2</sup> oceanic journey to melting.
