    I was given a voice. That's what people said about me. I cultivated my voice, because it
would be a shame to waste such a gift. I pictured this voice as a hothouse plant, something
luxuriant, with glossy foliage and the word <i>tuberous</i> in the name, and a musky scent at night.
I made sure the voice was provided with the right temperature, the right degree of humidity,
the right ambience.<sup>1</sup> I soothed its fears; I told it not to tremble. I nurtured it, I trained it, I
watched it climb up inside my neck like a vine.
    The voice bloomed. People said I had grown into my voice. Soon I was sought after, or
rather my voice was. We went everywhere together. What people saw was me, what I saw
was my voice, ballooning out in front of me like the translucent greenish membrane of a
frog in full trill.
    My voice was courted. Bouquets were thrown to it. Money was bestowed on it. Men fell
on their knees before it. Applause flew around it like flocks of red birds. 
    Invitations to perform cascaded over us. All the best places wanted us, and all at once,
for, as people said-though not to me-my voice would thrive only for a certain term. Then,
as voices do, it would begin to shrivel. Finally it would drop off, and I would be left alone,
denuded-a dead shrub, a footnote.
    It's begun to happen, the shrivelling. Only I have noticed it so far. There's the barest
pucker in my voice, the barest wrinkle. Fear has entered me, a needleful of ether,<sup>2</sup>
constricting what in someone else would be my heart.
    Now it's evening; the neon lights come on, excitement quickens in the streets. We sit in
this hotel room, my voice and I; or rather in this hotel suite, because it's still nothing but the
best for us. We're gathering our strength together. How much of my life do I have left?
Leftover, that is: my voice has used up most of it. I've given it all my love, but it's only a
voice, it can never love me in return.
    Although it's begun to decay, my voice is still as greedy as ever. Greedier: it wants more,
more and more, more of everything it's had so far. It won't let go of me easily.
Soon it will be time for us to go out. We'll attend a luminous occasion, the two of us,
chained together as always. I'll put on its favourite dress, its favourite necklace. I'll wind a
fur around it, to protect it from the drafts. Then we'll descend to the foyer, glittering like
ice, my voice attached like an invisible vampire to my throat.
