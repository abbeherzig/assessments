    Sure, you know their names, possibly better than you know the name of the street you
live on almost every writer does. When the need comes, these names drip lightly and
quickly off our tongues like they were our own brothers. I am thinking about the famed
eponymous<sup>1</sup> duo <i>Webster's Dictionary</i> and <i>Roget's Thesaurus</i>.
    But I dare say, almost none of us can identify the actual person or conjure up anything
about him. Don't report me, but neither did I until I started to write this column.
    <i>Webster's Dictionary</i>. Many people can respond immediately: Noah Webster. We are
aware that he is the father of the dictionary. But who was he? What did he do for a living?
When did he live?
    Noah was born in 1758, graduated from Yale University in 1778, and subsequently
graduated from law school. He produced the first American dictionary in 1806 and
published his sentinel work <i>An American Dictionary of the English Language</i> in 1828. His
interests led him to be a lexicographer,<sup>2</sup> textbook editor, author, Bible translator and spelling
reformer. He campaigned for years to secure nationwide copyright privileges for authors,
and he succeeded in 1790. His ubiquitous<sup>3</sup> mind produced extensive writings in epidemic
diseases, mythology, meteors, and the relationship of European and Asian languages. In
addition, he founded the first New York daily newspaper. He died in 1843.
    Another dictionary eponym almost as well-known is <i>Merriam-Webster Dictionary</i>. So
we have to ask, "Where did Merriam come from? What relationship does Merriam have to
Webster?"
    George and Charles Merriam purchased the right to revise Webster's dictionary after
his death in 1843. They produced several revised and expanded editions, and the
"Collegiate" series was begun in 1898. The C. and G. Merriam Company eventually lost its
exclusive right to the Webster name and in 1983, the company name changed to Merriam-
Webster, Inc. with the publication of <i>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</i>. The
C. and G. Merriam Company has been owned by Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. since 1964.
    That brings us to...
    <i>Roget's Thesaurus</i>. And it gives us the chance to learn about Roget, the man'
Peter Mark Roget. Who? What? When?
    Englishman Peter Roget, MD, was born in 1779. He studied medicine and mathematics
at the University of Edinburgh, entering at age 14 and graduating at age 19. He is
acclaimed as the creator of the first-ever thesaurus, a compilation of words and phrases
according to meaning rather than alphabetic order. It has been called one of the 3 most
important books ever printed, along with the Bible and Webster's dictionary.
    He began his monumental work <i>Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases</i> in 1805 but
did not release it publicly until 1852 - 47 years later. Meanwhile, he was earning a deserved
reputation as a distinguished physician and anatomist.
    In his lifetime, he became a noted lecturer and writer on anatomy, sewer sanitation,
magnetism, bees, geology, and more. He wrote a landmark paper, "Persistence of Vision
with Regard to Moving Objects," which stirred much research and dispute in the scientific
and optics community.
    When Roget died in 1869 at age 90, his son, John, took over the Thesaurus and he
gradually expanded it.
    [Physician and writer-what an interesting combination!]
    So now you know these men-the "-nyms"<sup>4</sup> in the eponyms. Not enough information?
