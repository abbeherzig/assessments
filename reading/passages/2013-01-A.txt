    ...Despite being overstretched, [Chef] Bugnard [of the Cordon Bleu cooking school]
was infinitely kind, a natural if understated showman, and he was tireless in his
explanations. He drilled us in his careful standards of doing everything the "right way." He
broke down the steps of a recipe and made them simple. And he did so with a quiet
authority, insisting that we thoroughly analyze texture and flavor: "But how does it <i>taste</i>,
Madame Scheeld?"
    One morning he asked, "Who will make <i>oeufs brouill's</i> today?"
    The GIs [my fellow students] were silent, so I volunteered for scrambled-egg duty.
Bugnard watched intently as I whipped some eggs and cream into a froth, got the frying pan
very hot, and slipped in a pat of butter, which hissed and browned in the pan.
    "<i>Non!</i>" he said in horror, before I could pour the egg mixture into the pan. "That is
absolutely wrong!" ...
    With a smile, Chef Bugnard cracked two eggs and added a dash of salt and pepper.
"Like <i>this</i>," he said, gently blending the yolks and whites together with a fork. "Not too
much."
    He smeared the bottom and sides of the frying pan with butter, then gently poured the
eggs in. Keeping the heat low, he stared intently at the pan. Nothing happened. After a long
three minutes, the eggs began to thicken into a custard. Stirring rapidly with the fork,
sliding the pan on and off the burner, Bugnard gently pulled the egg curds together-"Keep
them a little bit loose; this is very important," he instructed. "<i>Now</i> the cream or butter," he
said, looking at me with raised eyebrows. "This will stop the cooking, you see?" I nodded,
and he turned the scrambled eggs out onto a plate, sprinkled a bit of parsley around, and
said, "<i>Voila!</i>" ...
    It was a remarkable lesson. No dish, not even the humble scrambled egg, was too much
trouble for him. "You never forget a beautiful thing that you have made," he said. "Even
after you eat it, it stays with you-<i>always</i>." ...
    I was in pure, flavorful heaven at the Cordon Bleu. Because I had already
established a good basic knowledge of cookery on my own, the classes acted as a catalyst for
new ideas, and almost immediately my cooking improved. Before I'd started there, I would
often put too many herbs and spices into my dishes. But now I was learning the French
tradition of extracting the full, essential flavors from food-to make, say, a roasted chicken
taste really <i>chickeny</i>. ...
    But not everything was perfect. Madame Brassart [the school's owner] had crammed
too many of us into the class, and Bugnard wasn't able to give the individual
attention I craved. There were times when I had a penetrating question to ask, or a fine
point that burned inside of me, and I simply wasn't able to make myself heard. All this had
the effect of making me work even harder.
    I had always been content to live a butterfly life of fun, with hardly a care in the world.
But at the Cordon Bleu, and in the markets and restaurants of Paris, I suddenly
discovered that cooking was a rich and layered and endlessly fascinating subject. The best
way to describe it is to say that I fell in love with French food-the tastes, the processes,
the history, the endless variations, the rigorous discipline, the creativity, the wonderful
people, the equipment, the rituals.
    I had never taken anything so seriously in my life-my husband and cat excepted-and
I could hardly bear to be away from the kitchen. ...
