    ...We, the new explorers for the modern age, must rely to the fullest on the traditional
explorer's greatest asset: the human intellect. Unlike any other species on Earth, human
beings have the ability to look back in time and to learn. We know the strengths of the great
ancient civilizations as well as the catastrophic mistakes that crumbled empires. It was the
traditional explorer who blazed a trail to this past. The new explorers-all of us-must use
that trail to find our way to the future, to chart our course, and our children's course, into
the unknowns ahead.
    The past age of the lone explorer, Boorstin<sup>1</sup> wrote, opened at a time when medieval 
cartographers did not place "North" at the top of their maps. At the upper margins of their
parchments they drew instead a mysterious spot they imagined in the east: paradise, which
no living human had ever entered. Monks, looking for this garden "where Earth joins the
sky," became the first explorers; next, pilgrims wandered in search of the holy place; then
crusaders forged into new lands in the name of God; and finally, missionaries infiltrated 
farther into Earth's unknown corridors-all of them pushing back the boundaries of their
world in quest of paradise.
    On one of my own voyages, I think I found it.
    <i>Calypso</i> was exploring the waters of the Aleutian Islands, in Alaska. We sailed into an
unreal world-the sky, the ice, the water, all brushed by the indescribable light that makes
dusk indistinguishable from dawn during the season of the midnight sun. After I dropped
anchor off the island of Unalaska, our chief diver, Raymond Coll, climbed into our diving
saucer and took it down for a search under the surface of the sea. Raymond, who stayed in
contact with me by sonar telephone, described walruses and whales, vast pink fields of
krill-icy waters that brimmed with life.
    Above, on board <i>Calypso</i>, the team was uncharacteristically preoccupied with another
endeavor altogether. NASA had just landed a module on the moon, and the entire <i>Calypso</i>
crew crowded onto the fantail to listen raptly to the radio, awaiting the announcement that
a human being, Neil Armstrong, was about to step onto the lunar surface.
    Excitement electrified the atmosphere on board. We barely breathed. And then,
Armstrong's voice. A cheer rose from the deck and echoed in the crystal air. I switched on
my sonar link with Coll. "Raymond! Historic news! Armstrong is walking on the moon!"
    I felt a proud sense of fraternity that day with the NASA explorers who were reaching
into the distant corners of space even as our little team explored the depths of the sea. Yet
I also felt a sense of privilege that had to do not with the astronauts, but with the wet, blue
Earth on which they were gazing. Out in space, a human being stepped through dry lunar
dust. But Raymond sailed through a myriad<sup>2</sup> of life, undersea on the solar system's only
planet awash with liquid water.
    Several years later, the astronaut Alan Bean spoke to me about his own space voyage.
From the moon, he watched Earth spin through cycles of night and day. When the dark side
of Earth faced him, our planet appeared to be encircled by a girdle of sparks. It took him
quite some time to realize that these tiny glimmers were flashes of lightning from the 
quasi-permanent thunderstorms that ring the equator. He marveled: "The Earth looked like
a scintillating jewel."
    And that it is-the very reason why searching for ways to safeguard Earth is such a
necessity and such a joy. After all, the road to paradise-as the Spanish proverb goes-is
paradise.
