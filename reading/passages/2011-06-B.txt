    ...Inspired by another successful eradication [of malaria] in Sardinia, in 1955 the World
Health Organization (WHO) inaugurated what was then the most ambitious campaign
against disease in history, the Global Malaria Eradication Programme. The program
included spraying home interiors with insecticides and distributing antimalarial drugs to
people in affected regions. But WHO's efforts yielded only partial success. The disease did
disappear in Europe, Russia, Australia and most of the Caribbean. South Asia initially saw
dramatic reductions of infections, but the disease soon bounced back. Other hotspots fared
even worse.
    What went wrong? In a word, everything. The parasites fought back, becoming
resistant to common medications. The mosquitoes grew stronger too, as more and more of
them were able to survive insecticides. In some climates, mosquitoes bred so quickly that
insecticide applications simply couldn't keep up. All the while, local tribes were waging wars
of their own, which bogged down already-inadequate health infrastructures<sup>1</sup> and made public
health interventions difficult and dangerous. In 1969, WHO shut down its program.
National malaria-control programs followed, but they later fell into neglect or were
abandoned entirely. ...
    Spraying insecticides isn't the only way to use them. Mosquito-repellent bed nets<sup>2</sup>
treated with a class of insecticides called pyrethroids, which bind more easily to nets than
DDT,<sup>3</sup> cost just $1 to $2 apiece in Africa. And nets give some major bang for their buck: A
study published last year found that a 10-fold increase in nets resulted in 44 percent fewer
deaths among Kenyan children in the studied areas. In September of 2006, Kenya's
government used a $17-million Global Fund grant to provide 3.4 million
insecticide-treated nets to children. Zambia followed its lead. In 2006, 23 percent of
Zambian children slept under treated nets, up from 1 percent in 2000. ...
    In the face of widespread drug resistance, scientists have turned to a flowering shrub
called wormwood (<i>Artemisia annua</i>), the active ingredient of which, artemisinin, has potent
anti-fever properties. Since 2004, when WHO began promoting the use of artemisinin
worldwide, the drug has proved to be extremely fast-acting and effective against
<i>P. falciparum</i>.<sup>4</sup> WHO now recommends it or its derivatives as the first line of defense
against the parasite in areas where chloroquine<sup>5</sup> no longer works, such as much of
sub-Saharan Africa. Artemisinin is now one of the most powerful tools against malaria. ...
    Fortunately, powerful synthetic versions of the drug are on the horizon. Since 2000,
pharmaceutical scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center have been working
on an entirely synthetic antimalarial designed to mimic artemisinin. In preclinical lab tests,
the drug, called OZ277, was found to be even more effective than artemisinin derivatives.
The medication is currently in the last stage of clinical trials and, although a price for the
drug has not been determined, it will probably be less expensive than artemisinin. ...
    Complete eradication of malaria on the scale of polio will never be achieved without a
vaccine. Creating that magic bullet, however, has been a tremendous challenge. Obstacles
include the complexity of the parasites and their ability to quickly change and adapt. We
also don't completely understand our bodies' immune response to them. But a vaccine is
finally on the horizon. Over the past 25 years, the pharmaceutical company
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals has spent $300 million developing a malaria vaccine against
<i>P. falciparum</i>. RTS,S, as it's called, helps the immune system fight off the parasites by
blocking their ability to reproduce and develop in the liver, where they first arrive and
multiply. With grants from the Gates Foundation and other groups, the company recently
tested RTS,S on humans. Last October [2007], the vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of
malarial infection by 65 percent among infants in Mozambique'a huge victory. ...
