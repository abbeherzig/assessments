    Norman Rockwell didn't create his celebrated images using only brush and paint. They
often took shape first as scenes that Rockwell literally acted out, not only for his editors at
the [<i>Saturday Evening</i>] <i>Post </i>, but his real-life models, too. "It was strenuous," he once
explained, "but I felt it was the best way to get across my meaning." And so he would 
enthusiastically play out his visions and ideas, a one-man show packed with just the right
expressions, giving enough details of each persona in the scene to inspire his models and,
more importantly, get his editors to buy his ideas.
    Now, more than 30 years after his death, Rockwell is still acknowledged for deftly<sup>1</sup>
chronicling the best of 20th century American life with vignettes<sup>2</sup> of simple emotions
evoked by everyday people. This phenomenon is a resounding testament to Rockwell's
prowess as a storyteller and is the subject of another kind of one-man show: the upcoming
exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., titled Telling
Stories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The
exhibit, assembled from the private collections of these two popular film directors, will 
feature rarely viewed pieces of Rockwell's work, including George Lucas' favorite, 
<i> Lands of Enchantment</i>, which shows a youngster imagining himself as an armor-clad knight riding
away with a beautiful girl. The point is not the boy reading, but how the book inspires the
boy's imagination, taking him, in idealized form, to another time and place. ...
    "Storytelling was very important to Norman Rockwell," says Lucas. "Every image has
either the middle or the end of a story, and you can already see the beginning even though
it's not there. You can see all the missing parts of the story because he took that one frame
that sort of tells you everything you need to know.
    "And, of course, in filmmaking we strive for that. We strive to get images that convey,
visually, a lot of information without having to spend a lot of time at it. Norman Rockwell
was a master at that-he was a master at telling a story in one frame," explains Lucas.
    That concentration of information as well as emotion is something inherent<sup>3</sup> in
Rockwell's art. Emotion certainly spoke to Steven Spielberg when he first saw one of his
favorite Rockwell paintings, <i>High Dive</i>, the August 16, 1947 <i>Post</i> cover that depicts a boy
at the top of what must be (or so we imagine from the boy's expression) a towering diving
board. He crouches high above a swimming pool, too afraid to either jump or climb back
down. The painting hangs in Spielberg's office at Amblin Entertainment because it holds a
great deal of meaning for the filmmaker. ...
    Even in the creation of their work, Spielberg and Rockwell were more similar than is
immediately evident. To create his meticulously detailed recollections of everyday
American life, Rockwell worked much like a film director, not just acting out the scenes in his
imagination, but scouting locations, casting everyday people from his town for particular
parts, choosing costumes and props, and directing his performers to make them instantly
familiar to the public. Little wonder then, that filmmakers like Spielberg and Lucas, as well
as others, should be so inspired by his work.
    In directing his own scenes, Rockwell had a specific focus, just not one based on the
stark realism in which he grew up. Instead, Rockwell aimed to depict life in a kind of 
realistic fantasy. He later remarked in his autobiography, <i>My Adventures as an Illustrator</i>,
"I paint the world not as it is, but as I would like it to be." ...
