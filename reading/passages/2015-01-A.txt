    In all years and all seasons, The Bridge was there. We could see it from the roof of the
tenement where we lived, the stone towers rising below us from the foreshortened streets
of downtown Brooklyn. We saw it in newspapers and at the movies and on the covers of
books, part of the signature of the place where we lived. Sometimes, on summer afternoons
during World War II, my mother would gather me and my brother Tom and my sister,
Kathleen, and we'd set out on the most glorious of walks. We walked for miles, leaving
behind the green of Prospect Park, passing factories and warehouses and strange 
neighborhoods, crossing a hundred streets and a dozen avenues, seeing the streets turn
green again as we entered Brooklyn Heights, pushing on, beaded with sweat, legs rubbery,
until, amazingly, looming abruptly in front of us, stone and steel and indifferent, was The
Bridge.
    It was the first man-made thing that I knew was beautiful. We could walk across it, 
gazing up at the great arc of the cables. We could hear the sustained eerie musical note they
made when combed by the wind (and augmented since by the hum of automobile tires),
and we envied the gulls that played at the top of those arches. The arches were Gothic, and
provided a sense of awe that was quite religious. And awe infused the view of the great 
harbor, a view my mother embellished by describing to us the ships that had brought her
and so many other immigrants to America-the Irish and the Italians and the Jews, the
Germans, the Poles, and the Swedes, all of them crowding the decks, straining to see their
newfound land. What they saw first was the Statue of Liberty, and the skyline, and The
Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge. ...
    There was a long time in my life when I didn't see much of The Bridge, except from the
roof or the back window. The reason was simple: Trolleys were replaced by automobiles,
and nobody I knew in our neighborhood owned a car. But then when I was sixteen, I got a
job in the Brooklyn Navy Yard as a sheet-metal worker, and at lunchtime we would wander
out along the cobblestone streets beside the dry docks, and from there we could look up at
The Bridge. "Now the cats that built that," a black welder named Fred Thompson said to
me one day, "they knew what they were <i>doin'</i>."
    They certainly did. As I grew older, I came increasingly to see The Bridge as a 
monument to craft. It was New York's supreme example of the Well-Made Thing. All
around us in the sixties, the standards of craft eroded. As aestheticians<sup>1</1> proclaimed the
virtues of the spontaneous, or exalted the bold gesture, or condemned form as an artistic
straitjacket, I would cross The Bridge and wonder what they could mean. More than 
twenty men were killed in the construction of this thing, and others were ruined for life by
accidents and disease suffered in its service. To those men, carelessness meant death, not
simply for themselves, but for the human beings who would use what they were making. So
they had no choice: They had to make it to last. And in doing so, in caring about detail and
function and strength, they saw craft triumph into art. ... 
    Of course, it is the nature of all bridges that they travel in two directions. I know dozens
of people who traveled west on The Bridge, wandered the world, and then made the long,
wide circle home to Brooklyn. I don't know anybody who ever did that from the Bronx.
From the Manhattan shore, The Bridge still seems to whisper: "Come, travel across me. It's
only 1,562 feet across the river, and over here, and beyond, lies Oz, or Camelot, or
Yoknapatawpha County."<sup>2</sup> And from the Brooklyn side it speaks in plain, bourgeois<sup>3</sup> tones,
with a plain, simple message: "Come home." ...
