Reading comprehension is the ability to read a text and understand its meaning. This involves understanding of both word-level and sentence-level meaning. Reading comprehension is necessary to think critically about a text, evaluate what it says, and formulate an intelligent response. Since a “text” can be anything from an essay, to a textbook, to a newspaper, to a website, to an infographic, reading comprehension is an essential skill for success in course work, as well as in everyday life.

This reading comprehension assessment module is broken down into five domains (skill areas): (1) Ideas—the ability to identify and understand main ideas and key supporting details; (2) Inference—the ability to determine implied meaning; (3) Language—the ability to understand vocabulary items and interpret figurative language; (4) Structure—the ability to analyze the structure of a text; and (5) Purpose—the ability to identify how context and purpose shape the content and style of a text.
