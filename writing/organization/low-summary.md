Effective writing uses an appropriate form, or structure, to organize ideas. The DAACS writing assessment is assessed according to the structure of the essay, as well as the use of transitions between paragraphs. An essay without paragraph breaks will receive a 1 for the transitions criterion, even if you use effective words or phrases to connect paragraphs. To get an accurate score for transitions, please create breaks between paragraphs.
