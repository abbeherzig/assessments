Welcome to the writing assessment! The purposes of this assessment are to:

* provide an opportunity to reflect on your self-regulated learning survey results;
* give you feedback about your writing and suggestions for improving it, as needed;
* direct you to online resources that can help you strengthen your writing skills.

You will be asked to write a one- or two-page reflection on your SRL survey results. After your writing is assessed according to the criteria on the next page, you will receive feedback and suggestions intended to help you become a confident, successful writer in college.
