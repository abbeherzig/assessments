Welcome to the writing assessment! The purposes of this assessment are to:

* provide an opportunity to reflect on your self-regulated learning survey results;
* give you feedback about your writing and suggestions for improving it, as needed;
* direct you to online resources that can help you strengthen your writing skills.

You will be asked to write a one- or two-page reflection on your SRL survey results.
