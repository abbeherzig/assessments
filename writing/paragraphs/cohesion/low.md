## Paragraphs: Cohesion

Paragraphs have cohesion when the sentences are seamlessly linked together, permitting the reader to see the relationship between the ideas or information in one sentence and those in another sentence.  Cohesion is created when a writer explicitly links sentences and ideas using adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas), and/or the repetition of key words, as appropriate.
