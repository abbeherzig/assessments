The paragraph is the building block of an essay: Paragraphs organize ideas into manageable chunks, and show how they develop. DAACS essays are assessed in terms of whether paragraphs are consistently and clearly focused on a main idea or point, and the extent to which ideas are connected within paragraphs.
