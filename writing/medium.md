Writing is a critical skill for communicating your ideas. The primary purposes of the writing assessment was to: (1) provide an opportunity to reflect on your self-regulated learning survey results; (2) give you feedback about your writing and suggestions for improving it, as needed; and (3) direct you to online resources that can help you strengthen your writing skills. Below are your results for six important components of writing. Clicking through each section will provide some more information about your result including the rubric that was used to determine your result. Additionally, suggestions for improvement and links to resources are provided. 

The quality of writing is often subjective and difficult to evaluate. As such, there is sometimes variability in how results are determined. Feel free to reach out to your student mentor, advisory, or the writing center to discuss your results.
