<thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>Criteria</th><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Mastering</th><th>Emerging</th><th>Developing</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>Content</td><td>Summary</td><td>The essay uses relevant survey results and feedback to provide a detailed summary of the student's strengths and weaknesses in terms of self-regulated learning.</td><td>The essay uses evidence from survey results and feedback to summarize student's strengths and weaknesses in terms of self-regulated learning. The summary is a bit thin; lacks detail.</td><td>The discussion of the survey and feedback is superficial and/or simplistic.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Suggestions</td><td>The discussion of the feedback logically and explicitly leads to suggestions to which to commit.</td><td>Choices of suggestions to which to commit are clearly described.  The connections to the survey and feedback might not be explicit.</td><td>Choices of suggestions to which to commit are vague, if present at all, and/or not connected to the survey and feedback.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Explanation</td><td>The explanation for choices of suggestions is clear and reasonable.</td><td>The choices might not all be reasonably connected to the strengths and weaknesses discussed in the overview.</td><td>The explanjation of the choices is opaque; little evidence of logical connections.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Organization</td><td>Structure</td><td>The essay is well-organized, with an order and structure that present the discussion in a clear, logical manner.</td><td>The essay has a general structure and order.</td><td>The structure and order of the essay is muddled.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Transitions</td><td>Transitions strengthen the progression of the essay. When needed, ideas are linked together by transitions, by linking words and phrases (e.g., also, similarly, by contrast, in addition, then, therefore, etc.), or by repetition of key words and phrases. </td><td>Ideas are generally linked with transitions, as needed. </td><td>Paragraphs abruptly shift from one idea to the next, without transitions when they are needed.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Paragraphs Focus on a Main Idea</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Paragraphs are consistently and clearly focused on a main idea or point </td><td>Paragraphs are generally focused on a main idea or point.</td><td>Most, if not all, paragraphs lack one clear, main point; might have several topics.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Connecting Ideas within Paragraphcs</td><td>Relationship Between Ideas</td><td>Within paragraphs, the individual sentences are linked together seamlessly in a way that allows the reader to see the relationship between the ideas or information in one sentence and those in another sentence.</td><td>The ideas or information in each sentence within a paragraph are generally linked together, if only loosely. </td><td>The connections between ideas in sentences within paragraphs are unclear</td></tr>

 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Links</td><td>The writing explicitly links sentences and ideas using adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), and conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas).</td><td>Additional or better choices of linking words and phrases would clarify the connections b/w ideas within paragraphs.  </td><td>Little effective use of linking words and phrases.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Sentences</td><td>Correct</td><td>Sentences are correct: no run-ons, fragments, or errors in subject-verb agreement</td><td>Grammatically incorrect sentences, when present, are minor and do not interfere with meaning. </td><td>Significant problems with grammar.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Structure</td><td>Sophisticated variety of sentence structures. </td><td>Sufficient variety in sentence structure.</td><td>Lack of variety in sentence structure. Might be mostly subject-verb-object.</td></tr>

 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Complexity</td><td>Variety of syntactic complexity. </td><td>Complex structures used only occasionally. </td><td>Lack of syntactic complexity. </td></tr>

 <tr><td>Conventions</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are correct to the extent that almost no editing is needed. </td><td>Spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are correct to the extent that only light editing is needed.</td><td>Frequent errors in spelling, punctuation, and/or capitalization. </td></tr>
